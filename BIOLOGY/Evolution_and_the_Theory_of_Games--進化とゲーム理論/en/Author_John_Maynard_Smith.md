# John Maynard Smith

## Biography
John Maynard Smith (1920-2004) was a British theoretical biologist and geneticist who made fundamental contributions to evolutionary biology, particularly through the application of mathematical models and game theory to biological problems.

## Academic Career
- Studied engineering at Cambridge University before switching to biology
- PhD under J.B.S. Haldane at University College London
- Professor of Biology at University of Sussex (1965-1985)
- Fellow of the Royal Society (elected 1977)
- One of the most influential evolutionary biologists of the 20th century

## Major Scientific Contributions
- **Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)**: Pioneered the application of game theory to evolution
- **Sex and Evolution**: Major contributions to understanding the evolution of sexual reproduction
- **Mathematical Biology**: Advanced the use of mathematical modeling in biology
- **Animal Behavior**: Revolutionized the study of animal contests and behavioral strategies
- **Origin of Life**: Important work on early evolution and the origin of genetic codes

## Key Publications
- **Evolution and the Theory of Games** (1982) - This seminal work
- **The Evolution of Sex** (1978) - Classic study of sexual reproduction
- **Animal Signals** (2000, with David Harper) - Communication and signaling
- **The Origins of Life** (1999) - From the birth of life to the origin of language
- **Evolutionary Genetics** (1989) - Comprehensive textbook

## The ESS Concept
Maynard Smith's most famous contribution is the concept of Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS):
- A strategy that, if adopted by most members of a population, cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy
- Provides a solution concept for evolutionary games
- Bridges game theory and evolutionary biology
- Has applications far beyond biology, including economics and social sciences

## Research Philosophy
- Strong advocate for mathematical approaches to biology
- Believed in the power of simple models to illuminate complex phenomena
- Emphasized the importance of testable predictions
- Combined theoretical rigor with biological insight

## Impact on Evolutionary Biology
- Transformed the field of behavioral ecology
- Provided theoretical foundation for sociobiology
- Influenced understanding of cooperation, conflict, and communication
- Established evolutionary game theory as a major research program

## Awards and Recognition
- Balzan Prize (1991)
- Crafoord Prize (1999) - shared with Ernst Mayr and George C. Williams
- Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences (2001)
- Numerous honorary degrees and fellowships

## Legacy
- Game theory is now standard in evolutionary biology
- ESS concept widely used in economics and social sciences
- Inspired generations of theoretical biologists
- His mathematical approach to evolution continues to influence research

## Personal Characteristics
- Known for clear, elegant writing
- Ability to explain complex mathematical concepts simply
- Collaborative approach to research
- Mentored many prominent evolutionary biologists
