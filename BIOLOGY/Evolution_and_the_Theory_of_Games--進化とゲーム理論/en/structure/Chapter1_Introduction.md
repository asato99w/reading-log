# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith introduces the historical context of evolutionary biology and behavior, critiques group selection explanations, and sets the stage for applying game-theoretic thinking to evolutionary problems.

## Main Content
- **Historical Context of Evolutionary Biology**
  - Darwin's original insights on natural selection
  - Development of population genetics and modern synthesis
  - Limitations of early approaches to social behavior

- **Problems with Group Selection**
  - Wynne-Edwards' group selection hypothesis
  - Mathematical problems with group selection models
  - Individual selection as the more parsimonious explanation

- **Game Theory as a New Approach**
  - Introduction to strategic thinking in evolution
  - Why traditional optimization approaches are insufficient
  - Preview of the ESS framework

## Key Points
- Traditional evolutionary explanations often invoke group benefits inappropriately
- Individual selection provides more robust explanations for social behaviors
- Game theory offers a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions in evolution
