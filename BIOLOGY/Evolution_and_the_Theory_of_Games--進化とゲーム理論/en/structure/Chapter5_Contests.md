# Chapter 5: Contests

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith presents the famous Hawk-Dove game and its variants, analyzing fighting strategies in animal contests through cost-benefit analysis of aggressive behavior.

## Main Content
- **The Hawk-Dove Game**
  - Basic model with hawks (always fight) and doves (never fight)
  - Mathematical analysis of mixed ESS
  - Conditions for coexistence of strategies

- **Extensions and Variants**
  - Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game with ownership
  - Effects of varying costs and benefits
  - Population structure and spatial effects

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
  - Fighting costs vs. resource value
  - Injury costs and their evolutionary significance
  - Empirical measurements of costs and benefits

## Key Points
- The Hawk-Dove game provides a fundamental model for understanding animal contests
- Mixed strategies can be evolutionarily stable when pure strategies are not
- The balance between aggression and restraint depends on the cost-benefit ratio
