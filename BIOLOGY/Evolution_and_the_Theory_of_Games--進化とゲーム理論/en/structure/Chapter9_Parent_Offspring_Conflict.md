# Chapter 9: Parent-Offspring Conflict

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith examines Trivers' theory of parent-offspring conflict from a game-theoretic perspective, analyzing optimal investment strategies and the strategic dynamics of family relationships.

## Main Content
- **Trivers' Theory in Game-Theoretic Terms**
  - Conflicting interests between parents and offspring
  - Optimal investment from parent vs. offspring perspectives
  - Strategic interactions within families

- **Optimal Investment Strategies**
  - Trade-offs between current and future reproduction
  - Resource allocation among offspring
  - Termination of parental care

- **Sibling Competition and Family Dynamics**
  - Competition among siblings for parental resources
  - Birth order effects and family strategies
  - Strategic begging and parental response

## Key Points
- Parent-offspring conflict arises from genetic asymmetries within families
- Game theory provides a framework for understanding family dynamics
- Strategic interactions shape the evolution of parental care and offspring behavior
