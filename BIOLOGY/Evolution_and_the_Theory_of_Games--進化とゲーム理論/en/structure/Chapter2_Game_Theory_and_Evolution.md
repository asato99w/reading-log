# Chapter 2: Game Theory and Evolution

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith introduces the basic concepts of classical game theory and explains how they must be adapted for evolutionary contexts, highlighting the differences between Nash equilibria and evolutionary stable strategies.

## Main Content
- **Classical Game Theory Concepts**
  - Players, strategies, and payoffs
  - Nash equilibrium and its properties
  - Zero-sum vs. non-zero-sum games

- **Adaptation for Evolutionary Contexts**
  - Replacing rational players with evolved strategies
  - Population dynamics instead of individual choice
  - Fitness payoffs rather than monetary rewards

- **Nash Equilibria vs. ESS**
  - Why Nash equilibria may not be evolutionarily stable
  - The invasion criterion for evolutionary stability
  - Examples where Nash and ESS solutions differ

## Key Points
- Classical game theory concepts require modification for evolutionary applications
- Evolutionary stability is a stronger condition than Nash equilibrium
- Population thinking is essential for understanding evolutionary games
