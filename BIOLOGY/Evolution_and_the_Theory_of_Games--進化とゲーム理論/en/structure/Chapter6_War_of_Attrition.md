# Chapter 6: War of Attrition

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith analyzes contests of persistence rather than strength, examining optimal stopping times in conflicts and applications to territorial and mating disputes.

## Main Content
- **Persistence vs. Strength Contests**
  - Contests decided by time rather than fighting ability
  - Cumulative costs of persistence
  - Random vs. deterministic contest resolution

- **Optimal Stopping Times**
  - Mathematical analysis of when to quit
  - Exponential distribution of contest durations
  - ESS giving-up times in wars of attrition

- **Biological Applications**
  - Territorial disputes and boundary conflicts
  - Mating contests and mate guarding
  - Empirical studies of contest duration

## Key Points
- Wars of attrition involve fundamentally different strategic considerations than direct contests
- The ESS involves mixed strategies with specific probability distributions
- Contest duration should follow predictable statistical patterns
