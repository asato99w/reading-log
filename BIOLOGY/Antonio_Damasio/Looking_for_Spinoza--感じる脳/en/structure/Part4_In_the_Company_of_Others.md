## Key Points

1. **Social Regulation**: Emotions evolved not just for individual survival but to regulate social interactions and maintain group cohesion, making emotional intelligence fundamentally social intelligence that enables cooperation, fairness, and mutual support in human communities.

2. **Moral Foundation**: Moral emotions like empathy, compassion, and indignation have specific neural substrates and evolutionary functions, providing a biological foundation for ethical behavior while showing that moral development depends on cultivating positive emotional capacities.

3. **Cultural Integration**: While emotions have universal biological bases, their expression and regulation are profoundly shaped by cultural learning, demonstrating the importance of creating cultural practices and institutions that promote emotional wisdom and well-being.

4. **Future Implications**: Understanding the neuroscience of emotion has profound implications for education, social policy, and human development, suggesting that societies should prioritize emotional learning alongside cognitive development and create conditions that promote both individual flourishing and social cooperation.
