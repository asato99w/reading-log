## Major Research Contributions (by 1999)

### Consciousness Research
- Development of the first systematic neuroscientific theory of consciousness
- Distinction between core consciousness and extended consciousness
- Investigation of the neural correlates of self-awareness and autobiographical memory
- Studies of patients with various consciousness disorders

### Emotion and Decision-Making Studies
- Extension of the somatic marker hypothesis to consciousness research
- Investigation of how emotions contribute to self-awareness
- Studies of the relationship between feeling and consciousness
- Research on the role of brainstem and body mapping in conscious experience

### Clinical Neuropsychology
- Continued work with patients with prefrontal cortex damage
- Studies of anosognosia and other disorders of self-awareness
- Investigation of split-brain patients and consciousness
- Research on locked-in syndrome and vegetative states

## Theoretical Contributions (as of 1999)

### The Feeling of What Happens Theory
- Consciousness emerges from the brain's continuous mapping of bodily states
- The "feeling of what happens" as the core of conscious experience
- Integration of emotion, body awareness, and consciousness
- The role of the brainstem in generating core consciousness

### Core vs. Extended Consciousness
- **Core Consciousness**: Basic awareness of here and now, shared with many animals
- **Extended Consciousness**: Complex self-awareness involving memory and anticipation, highly developed in humans
- The relationship between these two levels of consciousness
- How extended consciousness builds upon core consciousness

### The Proto-Self, Core Self, and Autobiographical Self
- **Proto-Self**: Unconscious neural representation of the body's state
- **Core Self**: The fleeting sense of self in the here and now
- **Autobiographical Self**: The extended sense of self across time and experience
- How these three levels of selfhood interact to create human consciousness

## Methodological Innovations (by 1999)

### Neuroimaging Studies
- Use of PET and early fMRI studies to investigate consciousness
- Brain imaging of patients with consciousness disorders
- Studies of the neural correlates of self-awareness
- Investigation of the default mode network before it was formally identified

### Patient Studies
- Systematic study of patients with anosognosia (denial of illness)
- Research on locked-in syndrome patients who retain consciousness despite paralysis
- Investigation of split-brain patients and unified consciousness
- Studies of patients with various forms of amnesia and their impact on self-awareness

## Impact and Recognition (as of 1999)

### Scientific Influence
- Established consciousness as a legitimate field of neuroscientific inquiry
- Influenced the emerging field of cognitive neuroscience
- Contributed to the development of affective neuroscience
- Advanced understanding of the relationship between emotion and consciousness

### Clinical Applications
- New approaches to assessing and treating consciousness disorders
- Better understanding of vegetative state and minimally conscious state
- Insights into rehabilitation of patients with brain injuries affecting awareness
- Development of new diagnostic criteria for consciousness disorders

## Philosophical Contributions

### Naturalistic Approach to Consciousness
- Systematic attempt to ground consciousness in biological processes
- Challenge to purely computational theories of mind
- Integration of phenomenology with neuroscience
- Contribution to the "hard problem" of consciousness debate

### Embodied Consciousness
- Demonstration that consciousness depends on bodily awareness
- Challenge to disembodied theories of mind and self
- Integration of emotion and feeling into theories of consciousness
- Contribution to embodied cognition research

## Background to "The Feeling of What Happens" (1999)
This work represents:
- The culmination of Damasio's research on consciousness following "Descartes' Error"
- The first systematic neuroscientific theory of consciousness
- Integration of clinical observations with theoretical neuroscience
- A bridge between neuroscience and philosophy of consciousness
- Advancement beyond the emotion-reason integration to consciousness itself

## Social and Cultural Context (1999)
- **The Decade of the Brain**: Heightened interest in neuroscientific research
- **Rise of Consciousness Studies**: Emergence of consciousness as a serious scientific field
- **Cognitive Revolution**: Integration of psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy
- **Medical Advances**: Better understanding of consciousness disorders
- **Philosophical Interest**: Growing dialogue between neuroscience and philosophy of mind

## Personal Background and Collaboration
- Continued collaboration with wife Hanna Damasio on brain imaging studies
- Leadership role in establishing consciousness studies as a field
- International perspective bringing European philosophical tradition to American neuroscience
- Mentorship of the next generation of consciousness researchers

## Academic Standing in 1999
At the time of "The Feeling of What Happens" publication, Damasio was:
- Recognized as the leading neuroscientist studying consciousness
- Established as a bridge between clinical neurology and theoretical neuroscience
- Acknowledged as a pioneer in the scientific study of self-awareness
- Respected for integrating rigorous science with philosophical insight
- Viewed as a key figure in legitimizing consciousness research

During this period, Damasio positioned himself as the foremost scientific investigator of consciousness, providing the first systematic neurobiological account of how conscious experience emerges from the brain's monitoring of bodily states and emotional responses.
