- **The Extended Phenotype** (1982) - Extended the gene-centered view of evolution
- **The Blind Watchmaker** (1986) - Refutation of the argument from design

- Use of analogies and thought experiments
- Rigorous scientific argumentation
- Engaging narrative style that makes science accessible to general readers

## The Blind Watchmaker Context
This book was written as a direct response to creationist arguments, particularly William Paley's watchmaker argument. Dawkins uses computer simulations, mathematical models, and biological examples to demonstrate how natural selection can produce apparent design without a designer.

## Impact and Legacy
- One of the most influential popular science writers of the late 20th century
- Significantly shaped public understanding of evolutionary biology
- Strong advocate for scientific literacy and rational thinking
- Controversial figure due to his outspoken atheism and criticism of religion
