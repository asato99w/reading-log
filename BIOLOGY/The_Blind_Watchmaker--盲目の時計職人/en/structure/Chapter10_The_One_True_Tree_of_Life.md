# Chapter 10: The One True Tree of Life

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins presents evidence for the unity of all life through common ancestry, demonstrating that all living things share a single evolutionary tree connecting them to a common origin.

## Main Content
- **Universal Common Ancestry**
  - Evidence that all life shares common ancestors
  - The universal genetic code as proof of unity
  - Molecular phylogenetics and the tree of life

- **Convergent vs Divergent Evolution**
  - How similar features can arise independently
  - Why convergence doesn't imply separate origins
  - The difference between homology and analogy

- **The Deep Unity of Life**
  - Fundamental biochemical similarities across all life
  - Evolutionary relationships revealed by molecular data
  - The single tree connecting all living things

## Key Points
- All life on Earth shares common evolutionary origins
- Molecular evidence strongly supports universal common ancestry
- The tree of life reveals the deep unity underlying biological diversity
