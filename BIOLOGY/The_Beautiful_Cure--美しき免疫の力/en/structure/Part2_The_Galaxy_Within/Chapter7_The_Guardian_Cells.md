# Chapter 7: The Guardian Cells

## Chapter Overview
The discovery of tissue-resident immune cells, particularly macrophages, and their role as local guardians that protect specific organs and tissues throughout the body.

## Main Content
- **Tissue-Resident Macrophages**
  - Specialized macrophages in different organs
  - Microglia in the brain
  - Alveolar macrophages in the lungs

- **Local Immune Surveillance**
  - Continuous monitoring of tissue health
  - Rapid response to local threats
  - Maintenance of tissue homeostasis

- **Organ-Specific Protection**
  - Unique adaptations for different environments
  - Communication with other immune cells
  - Role in tissue repair and regeneration

## Key Points
- Each tissue has its own specialized immune guardians
- Resident immune cells are perfectly adapted to their environments
- Local immunity is essential for organ health
