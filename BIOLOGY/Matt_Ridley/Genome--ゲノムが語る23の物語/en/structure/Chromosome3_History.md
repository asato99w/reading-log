# Chromosome 3: History

## Chapter Overview
The CCR5 gene, which affects HIV resistance, demonstrates how genes preserve records of human history and population movements, serving as molecular archaeologists.

## Main Content
- **Genetic Archaeology**
  - How DNA sequences record historical events and population movements
  - Genetic evidence for human migration out of Africa
  - Population bottlenecks and expansions revealed by genetics

- **Disease and Evolution**
  - The CCR5-Î”32 mutation and resistance to HIV/plague
  - How infectious diseases shaped human genetic diversity
  - Balancing selection maintaining genetic polymorphisms

- **Population Genetics**
  - Geographic distribution of genetic variants
  - Relationship between genetic variation and human migration
  - Integration of genetic and archaeological evidence

## Key Points
- Genes contain detailed records of human evolutionary and migration history
- Disease resistance has been a major selective force in human evolution
- Genetic diversity reflects historical population movements and demographic events
