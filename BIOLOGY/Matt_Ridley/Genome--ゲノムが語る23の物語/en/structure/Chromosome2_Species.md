# Chromosome 2: Species

## Chapter Overview
Through the FOXP2 gene, crucial for language development, Ridley examines what makes humans genetically distinct from other species and explores the evolution of human language ability.

## Main Content
- **Human-Chimpanzee Differences**
  - Genetic comparison between humans and closest relatives
  - How small genetic changes create large phenotypic differences
  - The role of gene regulation in species differences

- **Language Evolution**
  - FOXP2's function in speech and language development
  - Genetic basis of human communication abilities
  - Evolution of language capacity in human lineage

- **Species Definition**
  - What constitutes a species from genetic perspective
  - Relationship between genetic similarity and species boundaries
  - Implications for understanding human uniqueness

## Key Points
- Humans and chimpanzees differ in only about 1.6% of their DNA
- Small genetic differences can have profound effects on phenotype
- Language ability has a significant genetic component that distinguishes humans
