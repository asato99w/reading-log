  - The molecular basis of cellular decision-making

- **Genetic Fundamentals**
  - The structure and function of genes and chromosomes
  - How genetic information is organized and expressed
  - The relationship between genes, proteins, and cellular function

- **The Genome Project**
  - History and goals of the Human Genome Project
  - Technical breakthroughs enabling genome sequencing
  - International cooperation and competition in genomics

## Key Points
- Life emerges from the complex interactions of many genes working together
