- Prescient identification of key issues that remain relevant decades later

### Potential Limitations or Criticisms
- Some genetic associations discussed have been refined or contradicted by larger studies
- Emphasis on individual genes may underemphasize polygenic nature of most traits
- Rapid advances in genomics since 1999 have made some technical details outdated
- Limited discussion of epigenetic mechanisms and gene regulation complexity

### Contemporary Relevance
- Foundational concepts remain valid and important for understanding modern genetics
- Ethical frameworks continue to guide discussions of genetic research and applications
- Narrative approach has influenced generation of science communicators
- Historical perspective provides context for understanding current genomic medicine
