# Nature via Nurture - Overall Structure

## Book Organization

"Nature via Nurture" is organized into a logical progression that builds from challenging the traditional nature-nurture dichotomy to presenting evidence for gene-environment interactions, and finally exploring the implications for understanding human behavior and development.

## Prologue: The Paragon of Animals
