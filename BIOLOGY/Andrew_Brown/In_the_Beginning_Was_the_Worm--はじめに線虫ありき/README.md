## What You'll Learn
- How Sydney Brenner chose C. elegans as the perfect experimental organism
- The technical challenges of mapping every cell and neural connection in an animal
- The international collaboration that produced the first animal genome sequence
- How 959 cells in a tiny worm revealed fundamental principles of development and genetics
- The social and scientific culture surrounding one of biology's greatest achievements

## The Story
Beginning with Sydney Brenner's visionary decision to study a simple worm, the book follows the decades-long effort to understand every aspect of C. elegans biology. From mapping its 302-neuron nervous system to sequencing its entire genome, this is the story of how a small community of scientists created the foundation for modern genomics.

## Scientific Achievements Covered
- **Complete Cell Lineage**: Tracing the development of every cell from fertilized egg to adult
- **Neural Wiring Diagram**: Mapping all connections in the worm's nervous system
