# Chapter 4: The Genome Project Begins

## Chapter Overview
This chapter chronicles the launch of the C. elegans genome project, describing technical challenges, strategic decisions, and early progress in sequencing the worm's complete DNA.

## Main Content
- **Project Initiation**
  - Decision to sequence complete C. elegans genome
  - Securing funding and organizing international collaboration
  - Establishing sequencing centers and coordination mechanisms

- **Technical Development**
  - DNA sequencing technology improvements and automation
  - Physical mapping and clone library construction
  - Quality control standards for large-scale sequencing

- **Strategic Decisions**
  - Shotgun sequencing versus clone-by-clone approaches
  - International division of labor and responsibility
  - Data sharing protocols and publication policies

## Key Points
- Large-scale genome projects require new technologies and organizational approaches
- International collaboration is essential for tackling ambitious scientific projects
- Strategic technical decisions at the beginning determine success of long-term projects
