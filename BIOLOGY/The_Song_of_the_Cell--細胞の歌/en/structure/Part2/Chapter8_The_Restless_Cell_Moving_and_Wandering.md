# Chapter 8: The Restless Cell - Moving and Wandering

## Chapter Overview
The mechanisms of cell movement and migration. From immune cells patrolling the body to cancer cells spreading through metastasis.

## Main Content
- **Mechanisms of Cell Movement**
  - Cytoskeletal dynamics
  - Actin and myosin interactions
  - Chemotaxis and gradient sensing

- **Cell Migration in Health and Disease**
  - Immune cell surveillance
  - Wound healing processes
  - Cancer metastasis mechanisms

## Key Points
- Cell movement is essential for life processes
