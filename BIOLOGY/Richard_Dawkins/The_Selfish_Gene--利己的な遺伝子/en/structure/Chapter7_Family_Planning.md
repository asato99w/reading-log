# Chapter 7: Family Planning

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins examines reproductive strategies from the gene's perspective, explaining optimal clutch sizes, parental investment, and the evolutionary logic behind family planning decisions.

## Main Content
- **Optimal Clutch Size**
  - Trade-offs between quantity and quality of offspring
  - Mathematical models for reproductive decisions
  - Environmental factors affecting family size

- **Parental Investment Theory**
  - Resource allocation between current and future reproduction
  - Sex differences in parental investment
  - Conflicts between parental and offspring interests

- **Life History Strategies**
  - r-selected vs. K-selected reproductive strategies
  - Timing of reproduction and lifespan trade-offs
  - Adaptive significance of different life histories

## Key Points
- Family size reflects genetic optimization rather than conscious planning
- Parental investment decisions follow predictable evolutionary logic
- Trade-offs between current and future reproduction shape life histories
