# Chapter 5: Aggression: Stability and the Selfish Machine

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins introduces evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) and game theory to explain why animals don't fight to the death, using mathematical models to understand aggressive behavior.

## Main Content
- **Evolutionary Stable Strategies**
  - Game theory applied to animal behavior
  - ESS as strategies that cannot be invaded by alternatives
  - Mathematical approach to understanding behavior patterns

- **Hawk-Dove Models**
  - Aggressive (hawk) vs. peaceful (dove) strategies
  - Costs and benefits of different fighting styles
  - Stable mixtures of behavioral strategies

- **Ritualized Fighting**
  - Why animals don't always fight to kill
  - Evolution of threat displays and submission signals
  - ESS explanations for animal conflict resolution

## Key Points
- Animal aggression is governed by stable strategic equilibria
- Game theory provides mathematical framework for understanding behavior
- Seemingly restrained behavior emerges from selfish genetic calculations
