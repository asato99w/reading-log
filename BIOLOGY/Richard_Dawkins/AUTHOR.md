# Richard Dawkins - Author Profile

## Biography

Richard Dawkins is a British evolutionary biologist, ethologist, and author, born on March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential science communicators and evolutionary theorists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

## Academic Background

- **Education**: Balliol College, Oxford (BA in Zoology, 1962; MA, DPhil, 1966)
- **Career**: Fellow of New College, Oxford (1970-1996)
- **Position**: Charles Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University (1995-2008)
- **Current**: Professor Emeritus at Oxford University

## Major Contributions to Science

### Gene-Centered Evolution
- Popularized the gene-centered view of evolution
- Argued that genes, not individuals or groups, are the primary units of selection
- Developed the concept of the "extended phenotype"

### Meme Theory
- Coined the term "meme" in 1976 in "The Selfish Gene"
- Proposed memes as cultural units of transmission analogous to genes
- Laid groundwork for the field of memetics

### Evolutionary Stable Strategies
- Applied game theory to evolutionary biology
- Explained seemingly altruistic behavior through genetic self-interest
- Advanced understanding of animal behavior evolution

## Writing Style and Approach

Dawkins is known for his clear, accessible writing that makes complex scientific concepts understandable to general audiences. He combines rigorous scientific argument with vivid metaphors and examples, particularly his use of biological analogies to explain evolutionary processes.

## Controversies and Debates

- Strong advocate for atheism and critic of religion
- Debates over group selection vs. gene-centered selection
- Discussions about genetic determinism and free will
- Public disagreements with other evolutionary biologists like Stephen Jay Gould

## Impact on Popular Science

- Transformed public understanding of evolution
- Influenced countless other science writers and communicators
- Bridged the gap between academic research and popular understanding
- Sparked widespread interest in evolutionary psychology and sociobiology

## Key Concepts Associated with Dawkins

- **Selfish genes**: Genes that promote their own survival and reproduction
- **Memes**: Units of cultural transmission
- **Extended phenotype**: Effects of genes beyond the individual organism
- **Universal Darwinism**: Application of evolutionary principles beyond biology
- **Replicator**: Any entity that makes copies of itself
- **Vehicle**: The organism that carries and protects replicators

## Intellectual Legacy

Dawkins fundamentally changed how we think about evolution by shifting focus from organisms and groups to genes as the primary units of selection. His work bridged academic evolutionary biology with public understanding, making complex evolutionary concepts accessible to millions of readers worldwide.

## Personal Philosophy

Dawkins advocates for scientific rationalism and critical thinking, viewing science as humanity's best tool for understanding reality. He argues that the natural world, properly understood through science, is far more wonderful and awe-inspiring than any supernatural explanation.
