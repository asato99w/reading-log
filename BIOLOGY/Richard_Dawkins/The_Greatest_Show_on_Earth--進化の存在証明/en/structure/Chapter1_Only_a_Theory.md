# Chapter 1: Only a Theory?

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins addresses the common misconception about the word "theory" in scientific contexts, distinguishing between the colloquial use of "theory" and its rigorous scientific meaning, while establishing the framework for presenting evidence-based arguments throughout the book.

## Main Content

### Scientific vs. Colloquial Use of "Theory"
- **Scientific theory**: Well-substantiated explanation supported by extensive evidence
- **Common misconception**: "Just a theory" implies uncertainty or speculation  
- **Examples**: Theory of gravity, germ theory of disease, atomic theory
- **Importance**: Understanding terminology crucial for evaluating scientific claims

### Hierarchy of Scientific Certainty
- **Hypothesis**: Testable prediction or explanation
- **Theory**: Comprehensive explanation supported by multiple lines of evidence
- **Scientific law**: Description of observed phenomena (not higher than theory)
- **Fact vs. theory**: Evolution as both observed fact and explanatory theory

### Framework for Evidence
- **Multiple independent lines**: Evidence from different scientific disciplines
- **Convergence principle**: Independent evidence pointing to same conclusion
- **Predictive power**: Theories that make successful predictions about new discoveries
- **Falsifiability**: Scientific theories must be testable and potentially disprovable

## Key Points
- The scientific meaning of "theory" indicates high confidence, not uncertainty or speculation
- Evolution is both an observed fact and a well-supported scientific theory explaining that fact  
- The book will present multiple independent lines of evidence that converge on evolutionary explanation
