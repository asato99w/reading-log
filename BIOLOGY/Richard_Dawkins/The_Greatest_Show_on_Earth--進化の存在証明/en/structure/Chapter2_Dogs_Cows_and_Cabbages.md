# Chapter 2: Dogs, Cows and Cabbages

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins uses artificial selection and selective breeding as a powerful analogy for natural selection, demonstrating how human-directed breeding of dogs, livestock, and crops provides clear evidence for the mechanisms underlying evolutionary change.

## Main Content

### Artificial Selection as Evidence
- **Dog breeding**: Dramatic morphological variation from common ancestor
- **Livestock improvement**: Selective breeding for desired traits in cattle, sheep, pigs
- **Agricultural crops**: Development of modern varieties from wild ancestors
- **Time scales**: Significant changes achieved in hundreds rather than millions of years

### Mechanisms Demonstrated
- **Variation**: Natural variation exists in all populations
- **Inheritance**: Traits passed from parents to offspring
- **Selection pressure**: Conscious human choice replaces environmental pressure
- **Cumulative change**: Small changes accumulate over generations

### Darwin's Insight
- **Artificial to natural**: If humans can direct evolution, nature can too
- **Pigeon breeding**: Darwin's detailed study of domestic pigeon varieties
- **Unconscious selection**: Even unintentional human preferences drive change
- **Power of selection**: Dramatic results possible through consistent directional pressure

## Key Points
- Artificial selection demonstrates the reality and power of evolutionary mechanisms in action
- The dramatic diversity achieved through human breeding shows what's possible through selection
- Natural selection operates by the same principles as artificial selection but over longer timescales
