# Chapter 6: Missing Link? What Do You Mean, Missing?

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins addresses the "missing link" argument by explaining how the fossil record actually works, why perfect preservation is rare, and how the transitional forms we do have provide overwhelming evidence for evolutionary change over time.

## Main Content

### Fossil Formation Reality
- **Preservation requirements**: Specific conditions needed for fossilization (rapid burial, mineralization)
- **Rarity of fossilization**: Most organisms decompose without leaving fossil traces
- **Sampling bias**: Hard parts more likely to fossilize than soft tissues
- **Geological processes**: How rock formation and erosion affect fossil preservation

### Transitional Forms Evidence
- **Whale evolution**: Complete series from land mammals to aquatic cetaceans
- **Horse evolution**: Progressive changes in limb structure and tooth morphology
- **Reptile to bird transition**: Archaeopteryx and other feathered dinosaurs
- **Human evolution**: Australopithecines and other hominid intermediates

### "Missing Link" Misconception
- **Linear thinking error**: Evolution as branching tree, not linear chain
- **Gradualism vs. punctualism**: Different rates of evolutionary change
- **Prediction fulfillment**: Fossils found where and when evolutionary theory predicts
- **Statistical expectations**: Why perfect fossil sequences are mathematically unlikely

## Key Points
- The fossil record's imperfection is exactly what we would expect given the rarity of fossilization
- Numerous transitional forms have been discovered that confirm evolutionary predictions
- The "missing link" concept misunderstands evolution as a linear chain rather than a branching tree
