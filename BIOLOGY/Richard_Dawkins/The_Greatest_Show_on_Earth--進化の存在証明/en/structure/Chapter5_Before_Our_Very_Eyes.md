# Chapter 5: Before Our Very Eyes

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins presents examples of evolution occurring rapidly enough to be directly observed by scientists, demonstrating that evolutionary change is not just a historical inference but an ongoing process we can witness in real-time.

## Main Content

### Laboratory Evolution Experiments
- **Bacterial evolution**: E. coli populations adapting to new environments over thousands of generations
- **Viral evolution**: Rapid evolutionary changes in viruses due to high mutation rates
- **Fruit fly studies**: Controlled selection experiments producing measurable changes
- **Experimental design**: Careful controls distinguishing evolutionary change from environmental effects

### Natural Population Changes
- **Peppered moth evolution**: Industrial melanism and subsequent recovery
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Evolution of drug-resistant bacterial strains
- **Pesticide resistance**: Insect populations evolving resistance to chemical controls
- **Darwin's finches**: Documented beak size changes in response to environmental shifts

### Rapid Evolutionary Responses
- **Cichlid fish speciation**: Rapid diversification in isolated lake environments
- **Island colonization**: Adaptive changes in species introduced to new environments
- **Climate change responses**: Species adapting to changing environmental conditions
- **Urban evolution**: Animals and plants adapting to city environments

## Key Points
- Evolution can occur rapidly enough to be directly observed and measured by scientists
- Both laboratory experiments and natural observations provide real-time evidence of evolutionary change
- The speed of evolutionary change depends on generation time and selection pressure intensity
