# Chapter 3: Accumulating Small Change

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins demonstrates the crucial distinction between single-step and cumulative selection, using computer simulations to show how gradual accumulation of favorable changes can achieve seemingly impossible results.

## Main Content
- **Single-Step vs Cumulative Selection**
  - The fundamental difference between random chance and guided accumulation
  - Why single-step selection is impossibly improbable
  - How cumulative selection makes the improbable inevitable

- **The Weasel Program**
  - Computer simulation of cumulative selection
  - Evolution of the phrase "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL"
  - Demonstration of the power of gradual improvement

- **Biological Applications**
  - How natural selection acts as cumulative selection
  - Each generation building on the previous
  - The ratchet effect preventing backward slippage

## Key Points
- Cumulative selection is fundamentally different from pure chance
- Computer simulations can demonstrate evolutionary principles
- Natural selection acts as a cumulative, not random, process
