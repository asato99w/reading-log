# The Extended Phenotype: Overall Structure

## Book Overview

"The Extended Phenotype" is Richard Dawkins' most rigorous and theoretical work, developing the gene-centered view of evolution with academic precision. The book argues that gene effects extend far beyond the boundaries of individual organisms, manifesting in environmental modifications, parasite manipulation of hosts, and animal constructions.
