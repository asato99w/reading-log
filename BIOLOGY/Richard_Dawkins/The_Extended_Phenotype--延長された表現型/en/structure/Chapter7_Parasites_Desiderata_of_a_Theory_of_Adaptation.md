# Chapter 7: Parasites: Desiderata of a Theory of Adaptation

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins examines parasites as ideal subjects for testing theories of adaptation, outlining the requirements (desiderata) that any adequate theory of adaptation must satisfy when explaining parasite evolution.

## Main Content

### Parasites as Test Cases
- Simple life histories making adaptive predictions clearer
- Clear fitness measures: successful reproduction and transmission
- Strong selection pressures creating obvious adaptations

### Desiderata for Adaptation Theory
- Theories must specify the entity that benefits from apparent adaptation
- Must identify the selection pressure responsible for the adaptation
- Must explain the mechanism by which adaptation arises

### Parasite Adaptation Examples
- Host manipulation behaviors increasing transmission success
- Virulence evolution balancing transmission and host survival
- Life cycle complexity as adaptation to multiple environments

## Key Points

1. **Parasites Provide Clear Test Cases**: Parasites offer some of the clearest examples of adaptation because their life histories are often simple and their success can be measured directly in terms of transmission and reproduction.

2. **Adaptation Requires Beneficiary Identification**: Any theory of adaptation must clearly specify which entity benefits from the adaptation - this is especially important for parasites where host and parasite interests conflict.

3. **Mechanism Matters**: Understanding adaptation requires identifying not just what is adaptive and for whom, but also the selective pressures and genetic mechanisms that produce and maintain adaptive traits.
