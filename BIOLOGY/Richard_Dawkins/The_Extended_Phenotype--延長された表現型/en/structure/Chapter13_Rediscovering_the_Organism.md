# Chapter 13: Rediscovering the Organism

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins concludes by reconciling the gene-centered view with the continued importance of organisms, showing how the extended phenotype concept enhances rather than eliminates the significance of individual organisms in evolution.

## Main Content

### The Organism's Role
- Organisms as the primary vehicles for gene expression and interaction
- Individual coherence and integration in extended phenotype framework
- The special significance of body boundaries in practical terms

### Reconciling Perspectives
- Gene-centered ultimate explanations and organism-centered proximate explanations
- Different levels of analysis for different biological questions
- The complementary nature of replicator and vehicle perspectives

### Future Directions
- Applications of extended phenotype theory to new biological problems
- Integration with developmental biology and ecology
- Implications for understanding human behavior and culture

## Key Points

1. **Organisms Remain Centrally Important**: The gene-centered view and extended phenotype theory do not diminish the importance of individual organisms - they remain the primary vehicles through which genes interact with the world.

2. **Different Perspectives for Different Questions**: Gene-centered and organism-centered approaches are complementary tools for understanding different aspects of biology - ultimate vs. proximate causation, evolution vs. development.

3. **Extended Phenotype Enriches Biology**: Rather than replacing traditional approaches, the extended phenotype concept provides additional analytical tools that reveal previously hidden patterns and relationships in the biological world.
