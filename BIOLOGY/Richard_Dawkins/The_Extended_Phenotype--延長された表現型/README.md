# The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene

**Author**: Richard Dawkins  
**Japanese Title**: 延長された表現型  
**Published**: 1982  
**Genre**: Evolutionary Biology, Theoretical Biology, Gene-Centered Evolution

## Book Overview

"The Extended Phenotype" is Richard Dawkins' most academic and theoretically sophisticated work, developing and refining the gene-centered view of evolution introduced in "The Selfish Gene." The book argues that gene effects extend far beyond the boundaries of individual organisms, manifesting in environmental modifications, host manipulation by parasites, and animal constructions.

## Key Themes

- **Extended Phenotype Concept**: Gene effects that extend beyond the individual organism into the environment
- **Gene-Centered Evolution**: Rigorous theoretical foundation for viewing genes as the fundamental units of selection
- **Environmental Engineering**: How genes engineer their environment through organism behavior and construction
- **Parasite-Host Interactions**: Parasitic genes manipulating host behavior as extended phenotypes

## Central Argument

Dawkins argues that we should view phenotypic effects of genes not as stopping at the skin of the organism, but as extending into the environment. A beaver's dam, a bird's nest, or a parasite's manipulation of its host's behavior are all extended phenotypes of the relevant genes.

## Structure

The book is organized into 13 chapters covering:
- Theoretical foundations and philosophical implications
- Constraints on evolutionary adaptation
- Parasites and host manipulation
- Animal artifacts and construction behavior
- Gene effects at a distance
- Relationship between genes, organisms, and environment

## Academic Significance

This book represents Dawkins' most rigorous theoretical contribution to evolutionary biology, providing sophisticated arguments for gene-centered evolution that influenced subsequent research in behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology, and parasitology.

## Target Audience

Unlike "The Selfish Gene," this book is written primarily for:
- Professional biologists and evolutionary theorists
- Graduate students in evolutionary biology
- Researchers interested in theoretical foundations of evolution
- Scholars examining the philosophy of biology

## Reading Approach

- **Theoretical Focus**: Concentrate on the logical development of arguments
- **Academic Rigor**: Expect detailed theoretical discussions and formal reasoning
- **Conceptual Innovation**: Understand how extended phenotype concept transforms evolutionary thinking
- **Empirical Examples**: Study specific cases of extended phenotypes in nature
