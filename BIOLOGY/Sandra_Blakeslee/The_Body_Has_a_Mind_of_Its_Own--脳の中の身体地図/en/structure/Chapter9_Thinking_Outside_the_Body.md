# Chapter 9: Thinking Outside the Body

## Chapter Overview
This chapter explores how body maps can extend beyond the physical boundaries of the body to incorporate tools, technology, and even virtual bodies. The authors reveal how the brain's flexible representation of body boundaries challenges traditional notions of where the self ends and the world begins.

## Main Content

### Tool Incorporation into Body Schema
- How skilled tool use leads to tools becoming part of our body maps
- The blind person's cane as an extension of the touch system
- Professional tool users showing neural incorporation of instruments
- The speed and automaticity of tool incorporation in body maps

### Peripersonal Space Representation
- The brain's mapping of space immediately around the body
- How peripersonal space expands and contracts based on tool use
- The neural systems that monitor and update space around us
- Cultural and individual differences in personal space preferences

### Virtual Bodies and Technology
- How body maps adapt to virtual reality environments and avatars
- The rubber hand illusion and sense of body ownership
- Remote operation of robots and telepresence experiences
- The surprising flexibility of body ownership and self-location

### Extended Mind and Distributed Cognition
- Philosophical implications of flexible body boundaries for concepts of self
- How technology becomes cognitively incorporated into mental processes
- The smartphone as an extended memory system
- Implications for human-computer interface design and artificial intelligence

## Key Points

1. **Flexible Boundaries**: The boundaries of our body maps are remarkably flexible and can incorporate tools, technology, and even virtual bodies into our sense of embodied self, challenging traditional notions of where the person ends and the external world begins.

2. **Tool Integration**: Skilled tool use leads to neural incorporation of tools into body maps, with the brain treating well-practiced tools as extensions of the body rather than external objects, enabling fluid and automatic skilled performance.

3. **Extended Cognition**: The brain's ability to incorporate external objects into body maps has profound implications for understanding cognition, suggesting that thinking and intelligence can be distributed across brain, body, and environment rather than confined to the head.
