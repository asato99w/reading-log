# Chapter 10: Out-of-Body Experiences

## Chapter Overview
This final chapter examines extreme alterations in body maps that can lead to out-of-body experiences, mystical states, and profound changes in self-perception. The authors explore how understanding these phenomena through body map research bridges neuroscience with spiritual and transcendent experiences.

## Main Content

### Self-Location and Body Ownership Disorders
- Neurological conditions that disrupt the normal sense of being located in one's body
- Cases of patients who feel displaced from their physical body
- The brain mechanisms that normally maintain self-location and body ownership
- How disruptions in multisensory integration can alter sense of self

### Experimentally Induced Out-of-Body States
- Virtual reality experiments that can create out-of-body experiences
- The role of visual-vestibular conflicts in disrupting self-location
- How sensory manipulation can make people feel they're in different bodies
- The surprising ease with which body ownership can be altered

### Meditation and Altered States
- How contemplative practices can alter body maps and self-perception
- Advanced meditators' reports of body boundary dissolution
- The neuroscience of transcendent experiences and ego dissolution
- Different meditation techniques and their effects on body representation

### The Neurology of Transcendence
- Brain mechanisms underlying mystical and spiritual experiences
- How alterations in body maps might contribute to feelings of unity and transcendence
- The role of the temporoparietal junction in self-location and spiritual experience
- Connections between body map disruption and religious or mystical states

## Key Points

1. **Constructed Self-Location**: Our normal sense of being located within our physical body is an active neural construction that can be altered or disrupted, revealing that self-location and body ownership are not fixed properties but dynamic processes maintained by multisensory integration.

2. **Experimental Accessibility**: Out-of-body experiences and alterations in body ownership can be reliably induced through sensory manipulation and virtual reality, making these once-mysterious phenomena accessible to scientific investigation and understanding.

3. **Spiritual-Scientific Bridge**: Understanding how body map alterations can create transcendent experiences provides a scientific framework for investigating mystical and spiritual states, suggesting that some profound alterations in consciousness may be rooted in changes to fundamental body representations.
