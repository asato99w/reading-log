# Chapter 6: Through the Looking Glass

## Chapter Overview
This chapter examines spatial neglect and distortions of body image following right brain damage. Ramachandran explores how the brain constructs our sense of space and body ownership, and what happens when these systems are selectively damaged.

## Main Content

### Spatial Neglect Syndrome
- Patients who ignore the left side of space after right brain damage
- Dramatic examples of neglect in daily life activities
- The difference between sensory loss and attentional neglect
- How neglect affects both external space and body image

### Distortions of Body Schema
- Patients who deny ownership of their own limbs
- Bizarre rationalizations for paralyzed limbs (anosognosia)
- The brain's construction of body ownership and self-awareness
- How body image can be selectively disrupted

### The Brain's Construction of Spatial Awareness
- Right hemisphere's special role in spatial attention and body image
- How the brain integrates sensory information to create unified spatial experience
- The constructed nature of our sense of space and self-location
- Clinical implications for stroke rehabilitation

## Key Points

1. **Constructed Spatial Awareness**: Our sense of space and our location within it is actively constructed by the brain and can be selectively damaged, revealing its non-obvious neural basis.

2. **Body Ownership is Neural**: The feeling that our body belongs to us is a specific brain function that can be lost, leading to bizarre denial of body parts despite normal sensation.

3. **Right Brain Specialization**: The right hemisphere plays a special role in maintaining awareness of space and body, with damage leading to characteristic patterns of neglect.
