# Chapter 3: Immortal Coils

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins explores how DNA achieves a form of immortality through sexual reproduction and genetic recombination, while individual organisms remain mortal vehicles for these immortal genes.

## Main Content
- **DNA as Immortal Information**
  - Chromosomes as libraries of genetic information
  - Digital nature of genetic code
  - Continuity through generations despite organismal death

- **Sexual Reproduction and Shuffling**
  - Crossing over and genetic recombination
  - Benefits of sexual vs. asexual reproduction
  - Genetic shuffling as survival strategy

- **Individual Mortality vs. Genetic Continuity**
  - Organisms as temporary vehicles
  - Genes as potentially immortal passengers
  - Death and reproduction from gene's perspective

## Key Points
- DNA is digitally encoded information that can persist indefinitely
- Sexual reproduction shuffles genetic combinations while preserving individual genes
- Individual organisms die, but genes can achieve immortality through replication
