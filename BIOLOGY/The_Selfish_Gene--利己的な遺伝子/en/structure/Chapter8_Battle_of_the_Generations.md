# Chapter 8: Battle of the Generations

## Chapter Overview
Dawkins explores the inevitable conflicts between parents and offspring, showing how genetic interests can diverge even within families, leading to evolutionary arms races.

## Main Content
- **Parent-Offspring Conflict Theory**
  - Divergent genetic interests within families
  - Trivers' theory of parent-offspring conflict
  - Mathematical basis for family disputes

- **Examples of Generational Conflict**
  - Weaning conflicts in mammals
  - Begging behavior in birds
  - Sibling competition for parental resources

- **Evolutionary Arms Races**
  - Escalating strategies between parents and offspring
  - Genetic manipulation and counter-manipulation
  - Resolution through evolutionary compromise

## Key Points
- Parents and offspring have overlapping but not identical genetic interests
- Family conflicts reflect deeper evolutionary tensions
- Natural selection shapes both parental resistance and offspring demands
