## Book Structure Summary
The book is organized into four main parts that follow both Benzer's scientific journey and the behavioral traits he studied:

### Part I: From Gregor Mendel to Seymour Benzer
- The history of genetics from Mendel to molecular biology
- Benzer's early life and transition from physics to biology
- The development of the field of molecular genetics
- Setting up the fly lab at Caltech

### Part II: Time
- Discovery of the period gene and circadian rhythms
- How genes control biological clocks
- The universality of time genes across species
- The molecular mechanisms of daily cycles

### Part III: Love
- Genetic basis of courtship and mating behavior
- The fruitless gene and sexual orientation
- How genes influence attraction and reproduction
- The complexity of behavioral genetics

### Part IV: Memory
- Searching for the molecular basis of learning
- Mutants with memory defects
- The connection between genes and neural circuits
- Implications for understanding human memory

### Epilogue: The Meaning of the Gene
- The broader implications of behavioral genetics
- Ethical considerations and future directions
- Benzer's legacy and influence on neuroscience

## Key Concepts and Themes
