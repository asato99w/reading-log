# Part II: Time

## Part Overview
This section chronicles the discovery of genes controlling biological clocks, focusing on Ronald Konopka's discovery of period mutants and how single genes can control complex rhythmic behaviors essential for survival.

## Main Content
- **Biological Clock Discovery**
  - Universal 24-hour rhythms in living organisms
  - Konopka's fruit flies with altered daily rhythms
  - Period gene as first known clock gene

- **Molecular Clock Mechanisms**
  - Period protein creating molecular oscillations
  - Feedback loops regulating gene expression
  - Neural circuits coordinating organism-wide timing

- **From Flies to Human Medicine**
  - Conservation of clock genes across species
  - Medical applications for sleep disorders
  - 2017 Nobel Prize recognition for circadian research

## Key Points
- Single gene mutations can dramatically alter organism's relationship with time
- Period protein creates cellular oscillations through negative feedback loops
- Clock gene research reveals mechanisms applicable to human health and disease
