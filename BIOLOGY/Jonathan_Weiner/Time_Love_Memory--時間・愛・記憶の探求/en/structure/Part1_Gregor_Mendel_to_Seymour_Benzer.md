# Part I: From Gregor Mendel to Seymour Benzer

## Part Overview
This opening section establishes the historical foundation for behavioral genetics, tracing genetics from Mendel to molecular biology and chronicling Benzer's journey from physics to studying the genetic basis of behavior.

  - Mendel's heredity principles with pea plants
  - Morgan's fruit fly work and chromosomal theory
  - DNA discovery and molecular biology revolution

- **Benzer's Scientific Journey**
  - Physics background and WWII radar work
  - Inspiration from Schrödinger's "What Is Life?"
  - Transition to biology and phage research

- **Post-War Physics-Biology Migration**
  - Max Delbrück and the phage group
  - Quantitative approaches to biological problems
  - Establishing behavioral genetics as legitimate field

## Key Points
- Scientific knowledge builds cumulatively from Mendel to molecular behavioral genetics
