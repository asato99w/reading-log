## Overview
This Pulitzer Prize-winning book tells the remarkable story of Seymour Benzer, a physicist-turned-biologist who revolutionized our understanding of how genes influence behavior. Using the humble fruit fly as his experimental subject, Benzer and his students discovered genes that control biological clocks, courtship rituals, and memory formation, fundamentally changing how we think about the relationship between genes and behavior.

## Key Themes
- **Genetic Basis of Behavior**: How single genes can profoundly influence complex behaviors
- **The Power of Model Organisms**: Using fruit flies to understand universal biological principles
- **Scientific Revolution**: The transformation of biology through molecular approaches
- **Nature and Nurture**: The interplay between genetic and environmental influences
- **From Physics to Biology**: The post-WWII migration of physicists into biological research

## What You'll Learn
- How the first "clock genes" controlling circadian rhythms were discovered
- The genetic mechanisms underlying courtship and sexual behavior
- How mutations can affect learning and memory
- The development of behavioral genetics as a scientific field
- The elegant experimental techniques used to study behavior in fruit flies
- The broader implications of behavioral genetics for understanding human nature

## The Story
The book follows Seymour Benzer's journey from physics to biology, inspired by Erwin Schrödinger's "What Is Life?" After working on radar during WWII, Benzer joined the molecular biology revolution, eventually establishing his famous "Fly Room" at Caltech where generations of scientists made groundbreaking discoveries about the genetic control of behavior.

## Scientific Discoveries Covered
- **Period gene**: The first gene found to control biological clocks
- **Fruitless gene**: Influences sexual orientation and courtship behavior
- **Dunce and Rutabaga**: Genes affecting learning and memory
- **Shaker**: Ion channel genes affecting neural function
- **Behavioral screening techniques**: Methods for identifying behavioral mutants

## Notable Scientists Featured
- **Seymour Benzer**: The pioneering neurogenenticist at the center of the story
- **Max Delbrück**: Nobel laureate and Benzer's mentor
- **Ronald Konopka**: Discovered the first clock mutants
- **Jeff Hall, Michael Rosbash, Michael Young**: Later Nobel Prize winners for circadian rhythm work
- **Students and colleagues**: The extended scientific family of the Fly Room
