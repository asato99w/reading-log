# John Maynard Smith - Evolution and the Theory of Games Context

## Pre-Publication Context (Late 1970s)

### Scientific Background
- Game theory had been developed in economics and mathematics since 1940s
- Evolutionary biology lacked rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing conflicts
- W.D. Hamilton's work on kin selection (1964) had shown power of mathematical approaches
- George Price's work on group selection provided mathematical insights

### Academic Development
- Recently established as Professor at University of Sussex (1965)
- Background in engineering provided mathematical rigor unusual among biologists
- Influenced by work with J.B.S. Haldane on population genetics
- Growing reputation for applying mathematical models to biological problems

## Writing and Publication (1980-1982)

### Motivation for the Book
- Need to synthesize scattered papers on evolutionary games into coherent framework
- Growing recognition that game theory could revolutionize behavioral ecology
- Desire to make mathematical concepts accessible to broader biological audience
- Response to limitations of traditional approaches to animal behavior

### Revolutionary Approach
- Introduced Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) concept systematically
- Applied game theory to wide range of biological problems
- Combined rigorous mathematics with biological insight
- Provided testable predictions for animal behavior studies

## Immediate Impact and Reception (1982-1985)

### Academic Response
- Rapidly adopted by behavioral ecologists worldwide
- Generated new research programs in animal behavior
- Influenced development of sociobiology and behavioral ecology
- Some initial resistance from traditional ethologists uncomfortable with mathematics

### Paradigm Shift
- Established game theory as standard tool in evolutionary biology
- Changed how biologists think about conflicts and cooperation
- Provided mathematical foundation for understanding animal contests
- Influenced economics and social sciences through biological applications

### Research Applications
- Inspired numerous empirical studies testing ESS predictions
- Led to development of new experimental methodologies
- Generated testable hypotheses about animal behavior
- Influenced conservation biology and ecology

## Long-term Legacy and Impact

### Field Transformation
- Game theory became central to behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology
- ESS concept adopted across multiple disciplines
- Mathematical modeling became standard in behavior studies
- Influenced entire generation of theoretical biologists

### Career Development
- Established Maynard Smith as leading theoretical biologist
- Led to numerous collaborations and international recognition
- Influenced his later work on major evolutionary transitions
- Set stage for his mentorship of new generation of evolutionary theorists
