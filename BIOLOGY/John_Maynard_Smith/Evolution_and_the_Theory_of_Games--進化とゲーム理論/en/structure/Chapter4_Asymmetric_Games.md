# Chapter 4: Asymmetric Games

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith explores games where players have different roles, information, or capabilities, focusing on owner-intruder contests and the role of assessment and information in animal conflicts.

## Main Content
- **Games with Different Roles**
  - Asymmetric strategy sets and payoffs
  - Role-dependent optimal strategies
  - Examples from territorial behavior

- **Owner-Intruder Contests**
  - Territory ownership and its evolutionary advantages
  - The "bourgeois" strategy and property rights
  - Empirical evidence from animal territories

- **Assessment and Information**
  - Role of size, strength, and resource-holding potential
  - Information gathering during contests
  - Signaling and communication in conflicts

## Key Points
- Asymmetric games often have pure strategy ESS solutions
- Information asymmetries can lead to complex strategic behaviors
- Conventional rules like "owner wins" can be evolutionarily stable
