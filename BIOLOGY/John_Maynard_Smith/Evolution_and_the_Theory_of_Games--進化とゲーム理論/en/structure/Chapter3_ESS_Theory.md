# Chapter 3: ESS Theory

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith provides the formal mathematical definition of Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS), establishes the mathematical conditions for stability, and explains the relationship to population genetics and dynamics.

## Main Content
- **Formal Definition of ESS**
  - Mathematical conditions: E(I,I) > E(J,I) or E(I,I) = E(J,I) and E(I,J) > E(J,J)
  - Interpretation in terms of invasion resistance
  - Pure vs. mixed ESS strategies

- **Mathematical Conditions for Stability**
  - First and second conditions for ESS
  - Relationship to evolutionary dynamics
  - Stability analysis using linear algebra

- **Population Genetics and Dynamics**
  - Replicator equations and their solutions
  - Connection to population genetic models
  - Computer simulations of evolutionary dynamics

## Key Points
- ESS provides a precise mathematical criterion for evolutionary stability
- The ESS conditions can be interpreted biologically as invasion resistance
- Population dynamics determine which strategies will evolve and persist
