# Chapter 11: Group Selection

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith provides a critical analysis of group selection arguments, examining when group selection might operate and clarifying the relationship between individual and group benefits in evolution.

## Main Content
- **Critique of Group Selection Arguments**
  - Historical group selection models and their problems
  - Mathematical conditions for group selection to work
  - Why individual selection is usually stronger

- **Individual vs. Group Benefits**
  - Distinguishing individual adaptation from group adaptation
  - Cases where group and individual interests align
  - Cases where they conflict

- **Conditions for Group Selection**
  - Strong group structure and limited migration
  - Group extinction and formation rates
  - Multilevel selection theory

## Key Points
- Group selection requires very specific conditions to overcome individual selection
- Most apparent cases of group adaptation can be explained by individual selection
- Mathematical models clarify when group selection might be important
