# Chapter 5: Sex

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith tackles one of evolution's greatest puzzles - why sex exists at all - exploring the costs and benefits of sexual reproduction and the evolutionary forces that maintain it.

## Main Content

### The Problem of Sex
- Sexual reproduction is costly: only half of offspring share parent's genes
- Sexual species should be outcompeted by asexual variants
- Yet sex is nearly universal among complex organisms
- The "twofold cost of sex" and its evolutionary implications

### Benefits of Sexual Reproduction
- Recombination creates new gene combinations and removes harmful mutations
- Sexual reproduction accelerates adaptation in changing environments
- Genetic diversity provides protection against parasites and pathogens
- Sex may facilitate DNA repair and reduce mutational load

### Sex Ratio Theory
- Fisher's principle explaining 1:1 sex ratios in most species
- Game-theoretic analysis of optimal sex ratio strategies
- Conditions leading to biased sex ratios
- Evolutionary stable strategies in sex ratio determination

## Key Points

1. **Evolutionary Paradox**: Sex presents a major evolutionary puzzle because its immediate costs seem to outweigh benefits, yet it persists, suggesting important long-term advantages.

2. **Recombination Benefits**: The primary benefit of sex appears to be genetic recombination, which creates variation and helps purge harmful mutations from populations.

3. **Game Theory Application**: Sex ratio evolution demonstrates how game theory can explain evolutionary outcomes, with stable ratios emerging from strategic interactions between parents.
