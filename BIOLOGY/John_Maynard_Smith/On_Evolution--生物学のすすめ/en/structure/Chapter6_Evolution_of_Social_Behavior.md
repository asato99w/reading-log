# Chapter 6: Evolution of Social Behavior

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith explores how social behaviors evolve, focusing on the apparent paradox of altruism and introducing mathematical approaches to understanding cooperation and conflict in social species.

## Main Content

### The Altruism Problem
- Altruistic behavior reduces individual fitness while benefiting others
- How can natural selection favor self-sacrificing behaviors?
- Examples from nature: alarm calls, sterile castes, parental care
- Need for new theoretical frameworks beyond simple individual selection

### Kin Selection Theory
- Hamilton's rule: altruism evolves when rB > C (relatedness Ã— benefit > cost)
- Inclusive fitness includes effects on relatives weighted by genetic relatedness
- Explains evolution of sterile castes in social insects
- Mathematical models of kin selection in various social contexts

### Social Insects as Model Systems
- Hymenopteran haplodiploidy and unusual relatedness patterns
- Evolution of worker castes and reproductive division of labor
- Conflict and cooperation within colonies
- Comparative analysis of social evolution across insect orders

## Key Points

1. **Inclusive Fitness Revolution**: Understanding social evolution requires expanding the concept of fitness to include effects on genetically related individuals, not just personal reproduction.

2. **Mathematical Precision**: Kin selection theory provides precise mathematical conditions for when altruistic behavior will evolve, transforming social evolution from speculation to quantitative science.

3. **Insect Societies**: Social insects provide ideal test cases for evolutionary theory, with extreme examples of cooperation and conflict that illuminate general principles of social evolution.
