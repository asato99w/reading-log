# Chapter 3: Heredity

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith explores the mechanisms of inheritance, from basic Mendelian genetics to population genetics, showing how hereditary patterns determine evolutionary outcomes.

## Main Content

### Mechanisms of Inheritance
- Mendelian inheritance and the particulate nature of genes
- Dominance, recessiveness, and codominance patterns
- Sex-linked inheritance and chromosomal mechanisms
- Molecular basis of heredity through DNA and protein synthesis

### Population Genetics Principles
- Gene frequencies and genotype frequencies in populations
- Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium as a null model
- Factors that change gene frequencies: selection, mutation, migration, drift
- Mathematical models describing evolutionary change

### Quantitative Genetics
- Inheritance of continuous traits controlled by multiple genes
- Additive effects and heritability in quantitative characters
- Response to selection in quantitative traits
- Genetic correlations between different characteristics

## Key Points

1. **Particulate Inheritance**: The particulate nature of genes (as opposed to blending inheritance) is crucial for evolution - it preserves variation and allows accumulation of favorable mutations.

2. **Population Perspective**: Evolution is best understood as changes in gene frequencies in populations, requiring mathematical models to predict and explain evolutionary outcomes.

3. **Quantitative Complexity**: Most ecologically important traits are quantitative, involving multiple genes and environmental effects, making their evolution more complex but also more gradual and predictable.
