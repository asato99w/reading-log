# Chapter 7: Evolution of Cooperation

## Chapter Overview
Maynard Smith develops game-theoretic models to explain how cooperation can evolve between unrelated individuals, introducing concepts that would become central to evolutionary game theory.

## Main Content

### Game Theory in Biology
- Adaptation as strategy in evolutionary games
- Payoff matrices representing fitness consequences of interactions
- Evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) as solutions to evolutionary games
- Examples: Hawk-Dove game, Prisoner's Dilemma, coordination games

### Conditions for Cooperation
- Repeated interactions and the "shadow of the future"
- Reciprocal altruism: "I'll help you if you help me"
- Recognition mechanisms and reputation effects
- Group structure and limited dispersal facilitating cooperation

### Models of Reciprocity
- Tit-for-tat and other reciprocal strategies
- Evolutionary tournaments and strategy competitions
- Conditions under which cooperative strategies invade populations
- Role of errors, forgiveness, and grudge-holding in reciprocal systems

## Key Points

1. **Game-Theoretic Framework**: Evolutionary interactions can be modeled as games where the best strategy depends on what others are doing, leading to frequency-dependent selection.

2. **Reciprocity Mechanism**: Cooperation between unrelated individuals can evolve through reciprocal altruism when interactions are repeated and recognition is possible.

3. **ESS Concept**: Evolutionarily stable strategies represent equilibrium solutions that cannot be invaded by alternative strategies, providing a powerful tool for predicting evolutionary outcomes.
