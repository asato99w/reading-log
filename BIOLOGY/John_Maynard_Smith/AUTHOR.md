# John Maynard Smith - Author Profile

## Biography

John Maynard Smith (1920-2004) was a British evolutionary biologist and geneticist, widely regarded as one of the most influential evolutionary theorists of the 20th century. Born in London, he made groundbreaking contributions to evolutionary game theory, the evolution of sex, and mathematical biology.

## Academic Background

- **Education**: Trinity College, Cambridge (BA in Engineering, 1941; PhD in Biology, 1951)

- Developed mathematical models explaining maintenance of sex despite its costs
- Contributed to understanding of genetic diversity and adaptation

### Mathematical Biology
- Pioneered the use of mathematical modeling in evolutionary biology
- Integrated population genetics with behavioral ecology
- Advanced theoretical framework for evolutionary processes
- Influenced entire generation of theoretical biologists

- **Parent-offspring conflict**: Game-theoretic analysis of family dynamics
- **Group selection**: Critical analysis of selection at different levels

## Impact on Evolutionary Biology

### Theoretical Foundations
- Provided mathematical rigor to evolutionary arguments
- Established game theory as standard tool in evolutionary biology
- Influenced development of behavioral ecology as discipline
- Created framework for analyzing social evolution

### Educational Influence
- Trained numerous influential evolutionary biologists
- Wrote accessible textbooks that shaped generations of students

- Served as mentor and collaborator to many prominent scientists

## Intellectual Legacy

Maynard Smith fundamentally changed how evolutionary biologists think about behavior, conflict, and cooperation. His mathematical approach provided precise tools for analyzing evolutionary scenarios that had previously been addressed only through verbal arguments. His work on game theory in biology became foundational for understanding everything from animal contests to the evolution of cooperation.

## Collaboration and Mentorship

- Worked with leading evolutionary biologists including W.D. Hamilton, George Price, and Richard Dawkins
- Mentored many successful evolutionary biologists who continued his theoretical tradition
- Active in scientific societies and committees
- Promoted international collaboration in evolutionary biology

## Personal Characteristics

Known for his clarity of thought, mathematical precision, and ability to identify the most important questions in evolutionary biology. Despite his technical expertise, he was also known for making complex mathematical concepts accessible to broader audiences through clear writing and engaging presentations.
