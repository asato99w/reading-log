# Chapter 5: X-ray Evidence

## Chapter Overview
Watson describes the crucial X-ray crystallography work of Rosalind Franklin, particularly Photo 51, which provided key evidence for the helical structure of DNA.

## Main Content
- **Franklin's Work**
  - Expert crystallographer producing best DNA images
  - Methodical, careful experimental approach
  - Reluctant to speculate beyond data

- **Photo 51 Revelation**
  - Wilkins shows Watson Franklin's photograph
  - Clear evidence of helical structure
  - Provides crucial parameters for model

- **Data Interpretation**
  - Understanding helical diffraction patterns
  - Determining number of strands
  - Measuring helical pitch and diameter

## Key Points
- Franklin's data was crucial but she hadn't fully interpreted it
- Photo 51 provided "eureka" moment for Watson
- Ethical questions about using Franklin's data without permission
