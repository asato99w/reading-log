# Chapter 7: The Model Building

## Chapter Overview
Watson describes the frantic construction of the double helix model once they understood base pairing, racing to complete it before anyone else makes the discovery.

## Main Content
- **Urgent Construction**
  - Machine shop makes metal bases
  - Careful building of accurate model
  - Checking all parameters against data

- **Double Helix Features**
  - Two antiparallel strands
  - Sugar-phosphate backbone outside
  - Bases paired inside

- **Verification Process**
  - Fits all of Franklin's data
  - Satisfies chemical requirements
  - Explains biological properties

## Key Points
- Model building was rapid once base pairing was understood
- Physical model helped verify all structural features
- Everything fit perfectly - strong indication they were right
