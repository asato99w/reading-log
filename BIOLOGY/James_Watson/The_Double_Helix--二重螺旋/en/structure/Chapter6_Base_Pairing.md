# Chapter 6: Base Pairing

## Chapter Overview
The breakthrough chapter where Watson discovers complementary base pairing - that A pairs with T and G pairs with C - solving the puzzle of DNA structure.

## Main Content
- **Chargaff's Rules**
  - Amount of A equals T, G equals C
  - Initially didn't understand significance
  - Key clue to pairing mechanism

- **Wrong Attempts**
  - Like-with-like pairing idea fails
  - Incorrect chemical forms of bases
  - Jerry Donohue's crucial correction

- **The Breakthrough**
  - Complementary base pairing insight
  - Hydrogen bonds between base pairs
  - Immediately suggests replication mechanism

## Key Points
- Solution came suddenly after long preparation
- Base pairing was the key insight that solved everything
- Structure immediately suggested function - how DNA replicates
