# Chapter 3: The Triple Helix Fiasco

## Chapter Overview
Watson recounts their first failed attempt at building a DNA model - a triple helix that was quickly shown to be wrong, resulting in their being banned from working on DNA.

## Main Content
- **First Model Attempt**
  - Three-stranded helix with phosphates in center
  - Based on incomplete understanding of water content
  - Rushed construction before proper data analysis

- **The Presentation Disaster**
  - Invited Franklin and Wilkins to view model
  - Franklin immediately identified fatal flaws
  - Humiliating failure in front of rivals

- **Consequences**
  - Lawrence Bragg forbids further DNA work
  - Damaged credibility with colleagues
  - Forced to focus on other projects

## Key Points
- Early failure taught important lessons about DNA structure
- Showed dangers of building models without sufficient data
- Established pattern of rivalry with Franklin and Wilkins
