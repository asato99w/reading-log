# Part I: Chemistry and Information

## Part Overview
This foundational section establishes the chemical and physical principles underlying molecular biology, introducing the structure and properties of biological macromolecules and the central dogma governing genetic information flow.

## Main Content
- **Chemical Foundations**
  - Weak chemical interactions driving molecular recognition
  - Thermodynamic principles governing biological processes
  - pH and ionic effects on molecular structure

- **Nucleic Acid Structure**
  - DNA double helix structure and base pairing rules
  - RNA structure and functional diversity
  - Nucleic acid-protein interactions

- **Protein Structure and Function**
  - Primary through quaternary structure relationships
  - Enzyme catalysis and regulation
  - Protein folding and stability

## Key Points
- Weak interactions are crucial for biological specificity and regulation
- Complementary base pairing underlies information storage and transfer
- Protein structure directly determines biological function
