# Part II: Maintenance of the Genome

## Part Overview
This section explores how genetic information is faithfully preserved and transmitted, covering DNA replication, repair mechanisms, and recombination processes that maintain genome integrity while allowing evolution.

## Main Content
- **DNA Replication**
  - Semi-conservative replication mechanism
  - DNA polymerases and replication machinery
  - Proofreading and error correction

- **Chromosome Structure**
  - Chromatin organization and nucleosome structure
  - Chromosome packaging and condensation
  - Telomeres and chromosome stability

- **DNA Repair and Recombination**
  - Multiple repair pathways for different damage types
  - Homologous recombination mechanisms
  - Site-specific recombination and transposition

## Key Points
- DNA replication maintains high fidelity through multiple mechanisms
- Chromatin structure balances DNA accessibility with protection
- Repair and recombination systems ensure genome stability while enabling evolution
