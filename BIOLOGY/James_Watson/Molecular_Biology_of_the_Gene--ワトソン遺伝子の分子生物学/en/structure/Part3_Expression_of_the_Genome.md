# Part III: Expression of the Genome

## Part Overview
This section details how genetic information is converted into functional products through transcription and translation, implementing the central dogma with sophisticated processing and regulation.

## Main Content
- **Transcription and RNA Processing**
  - RNA polymerase mechanisms and regulation
  - RNA splicing and alternative splicing
  - mRNA capping and polyadenylation

- **Translation**
  - Genetic code and codon usage
  - Ribosome structure and function
  - Translation factors and regulation

- **Protein Folding and Function**
  - Co-translational and post-translational folding
  - Chaperones and protein quality control
  - Post-translational modifications

## Key Points
- RNA processing greatly increases protein diversity from limited genome
- Translation machinery is highly conserved across all life forms
- Protein folding is critical for function and cellular health
