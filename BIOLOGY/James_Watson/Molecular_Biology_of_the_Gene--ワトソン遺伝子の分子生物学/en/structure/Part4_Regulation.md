# Part IV: Regulation

## Part Overview
This section examines sophisticated control mechanisms determining when, where, and how much gene expression occurs, from simple bacterial systems to complex eukaryotic development and cell cycle control.

## Main Content
- **Gene Regulation Principles**
  - Prokaryotic operons and global regulation
  - Eukaryotic transcriptional control and chromatin
  - Epigenetic modifications and inheritance

- **Regulatory RNAs**
  - microRNAs and RNA interference
  - Long non-coding RNAs
  - Small interfering RNAs and gene silencing

- **Cell Cycle and Apoptosis**
  - Cell cycle checkpoints and control
  - Cyclin-dependent kinases and regulation
  - Programmed cell death pathways

## Key Points
- Gene regulation operates at multiple levels from transcription to post-translation
- Regulatory RNAs add layers of control beyond protein factors
- Cell cycle control and apoptosis maintain tissue homeostasis
