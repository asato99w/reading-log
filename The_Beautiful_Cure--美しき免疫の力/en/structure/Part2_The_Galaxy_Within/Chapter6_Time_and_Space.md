# Chapter 6: Time and Space

## Chapter Overview
The discovery of circadian rhythms in immune function and how the immune system operates differently across time and anatomical locations in the body.

## Main Content
- **Circadian Immune Rhythms**
  - Daily cycles of immune cell activity
  - Timing of immune responses and infections
  - Molecular clocks in immune cells

- **Spatial Organization of Immunity**
  - Tissue-specific immune environments
  - Immune cell migration patterns
  - Anatomical specialization of immune responses

- **Clinical Implications**
  - Optimal timing for vaccinations
  - Chronotherapy and immune treatments
  - Understanding infection patterns

## Key Points
- Immune function follows daily rhythms
- Location matters for immune responses
- Timing can optimize immune treatments
