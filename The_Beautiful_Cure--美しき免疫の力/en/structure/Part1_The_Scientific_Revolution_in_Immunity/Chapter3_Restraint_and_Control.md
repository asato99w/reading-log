# Chapter 3: Restraint and Control

## Chapter Overview
The discovery of immune regulation mechanisms, particularly regulatory T cells by Shimon Sakaguchi, and how the immune system maintains balance to prevent harmful autoimmune responses.

## Main Content
- **Discovery of Regulatory T Cells**
  - Shimon Sakaguchi's groundbreaking research
  - CD25+ T cells and immune suppression
  - Overturning conventional immunological thinking

- **Immune Tolerance Mechanisms**
  - Prevention of autoimmune diseases
  - Balance between immunity and tolerance
  - Central and peripheral tolerance

- **Clinical Implications**
  - Understanding autoimmune disorders
  - Therapeutic applications of Tregs
  - Transplantation medicine advances

## Key Points
- The immune system has built-in brakes to prevent overreaction
- Regulatory T cells are essential for immune balance
- Loss of immune regulation leads to autoimmune diseases
