# Author: Christopher Alexander and Colleagues

## Context During "The Production of Houses" (1985)

At the time of "The Production of Houses," Christopher Alexander was 48 years old and at the height of his experimental period, having completed both theoretical foundations and institutional applications of pattern language theory. This work represents his most ambitious attempt to apply pattern language concepts to actual housing construction, moving from campus buildings to individual family homes.

At 48, Alexander was at the height of his practical experimentation period, with "The Production of Houses" representing the culmination of his efforts to translate pattern language theory into actual construction practice. This project established him as a pioneer not just in design theory but in community development and alternative construction management, demonstrating that pattern-based approaches could work at the scale of individual family homebuilding while building broader community capacity.
