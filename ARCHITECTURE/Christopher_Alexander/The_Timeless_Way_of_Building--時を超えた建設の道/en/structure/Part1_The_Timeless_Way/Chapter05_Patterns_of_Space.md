# Chapter 5: Patterns of Space

## Chapter Overview
Explores how patterns of events naturally lead to patterns of space, showing the geometric configurations that support human activities.

## Main Content
- **Spatial Configurations**
  - How events translate into spatial forms
  - Recurring geometric patterns in architecture
  - The relationship between function and form

- **Universal Spatial Patterns**
  - Common configurations across cultures
  - Basic spatial relationships that work
  - The geometry of human-scale spaces

- **Creating Supportive Spaces**
  - Matching spatial patterns to event patterns
  - The importance of proper dimensions and proportions
  - How spaces can enhance or inhibit activities

## Key Points
- Patterns of space emerge from patterns of events
- Certain spatial configurations naturally support life
- Geometry and proportion are essential to living spaces
