# Chapter 19: Differentiating Space

## Chapter Overview
Describes the fundamental process by which undifferentiated space becomes specific, functional places through pattern application.

## Main Content
- **The Differentiation Process**
  - Beginning with undifferentiated space
  - Gradual subdivision based on functional needs
  - Each step creating more specific conditions

- **Pattern-Guided Division**
  - Using patterns to determine spatial divisions
  - Resolving conflicts between different needs
  - Creating harmony between adjacent spaces

- **Emergence of Character**
  - How specific places develop unique identity
  - The relationship between function and spatial character
  - Creating spaces that feel right for their purpose

## Key Points
- Differentiation is the basic process of creating places
- Patterns guide the division and specification of space
- Each differentiation should resolve conflicts and improve the whole
