# Section 7: Implications for City Design and Planning

## Section Overview
This section translates the theoretical insights about tree vs semi-lattice organization into practical principles for urban planning and design, providing concrete guidance for creating more vital cities.

## Main Content
- **Zoning and Land Use Reform**
  - Move beyond single-use zoning toward mixed-use, overlapping districts
  - Allow residential, commercial, and institutional uses to intermingle
  - Create transition zones rather than sharp boundaries between different areas
  - Enable incremental change and adaptation over time

- **Transportation and Infrastructure**
  - Design transportation systems with overlapping service areas
  - Create multiple route choices rather than hierarchical hub-and-spoke systems
  - Integrate different transportation modes (walking, cycling, transit, cars)
  - Allow infrastructure to serve multiple functions simultaneously

- **Public Space and Community Facilities**
  - Design spaces that serve multiple communities and purposes
  - Create overlapping catchment areas for schools, parks, and community centers
  - Enable spaces to accommodate different activities at different times
  - Foster chance encounters between different social groups

## Key Points
- Semi-lattice design principles can be implemented through specific planning reforms
- Multiple overlapping systems create more resilient and adaptable urban environments
- Good city design enables rather than controls the complex interactions that create urban vitality
