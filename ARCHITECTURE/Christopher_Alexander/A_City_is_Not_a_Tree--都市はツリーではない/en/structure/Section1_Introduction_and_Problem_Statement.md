# Section 1: Introduction and Problem Statement

## Section Overview
This opening section establishes Alexander's central thesis by presenting the fundamental distinction between artificial and natural cities, introducing the tree/semi-lattice framework that will structure the entire argument.

## Main Content
- **The Provocative Opening**
  - Bold statement that artificial cities lack the vitality of natural ones
  - Introduction of tree vs semi-lattice as analytical framework
  - Promise that mathematical analysis will explain the difference
  - Challenge to conventional planning assumptions about rational design

- **Initial Examples and Contrasts**
  - Artificial cities: Bras√≠lia, Chandigarh, Columbia Maryland as examples of planned environments
  - Natural cities: Traditional European cities, Greenwich Village, Cambridge as evolved environments
  - Immediate visceral recognition of the difference before mathematical analysis
  - Setting up the puzzle that mathematical framework will solve

- **Framework Introduction**
  - Cities as collections of units organized into larger collections
  - Tree organization: hierarchical, non-overlapping, administratively clean
  - Semi-lattice organization: overlapping, complex, vitally messy
  - Preview that mathematical analysis will show why semi-lattice creates vitality

## Key Points
- The difference between artificial and natural cities is structurally based, not merely aesthetic
- Mathematical analysis can illuminate design problems previously understood only intuitively
- The tree/semi-lattice distinction provides a precise analytical framework for urban structure
