# Section 4: Examples of Semi-lattice Cities

## Section Overview
This section demonstrates how successful traditional cities exhibit semi-lattice organization through overlapping functions, boundaries, and social networks that create urban vitality and adaptability.

## Main Content
- **Paris: Traditional Urban Complexity**

  - University colleges integrated throughout city fabric
  - Students, faculty, and townspeople sharing same spaces and services
  - Academic and civic institutions with overlapping functions
  - Pedestrian and cycling networks creating multiple route choices
