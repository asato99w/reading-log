# Section 2: Mathematical Foundation - Sets and Structure

## Section Overview
This section provides the rigorous mathematical foundation for distinguishing tree from semi-lattice organization using set theory, establishing the analytical framework that will be applied to urban examples.

## Main Content
- **Set-Theoretic Foundation**
  - Cities defined as collections of units (buildings, streets, neighborhoods)
  - Units organized into larger collections (districts, functional areas)
  - Mathematical representation of city structure using set notation
  - Clear definitions enabling precise analysis of organizational patterns

- **Tree Structure Definition**
  - Tree property: no two collections overlap at the same hierarchical level
  - Each unit belongs to exactly one collection at each level
  - Clear hierarchical boundaries with no ambiguity
  - Examples: organizational charts, taxonomic classifications, zoning maps

- **Semi-lattice Structure Definition**
  - Semi-lattice property: collections can overlap at any level
  - Units can belong to multiple collections simultaneously
  - Complex relationships between collections allowed
  - Examples: social networks, traditional city neighborhoods, ecosystem relationships

## Key Points
- Set theory provides precise language for describing city organization patterns
- Tree structures are special, restricted cases of semi-lattice structures
- Mathematical definition enables objective analysis of urban organizational complexity
