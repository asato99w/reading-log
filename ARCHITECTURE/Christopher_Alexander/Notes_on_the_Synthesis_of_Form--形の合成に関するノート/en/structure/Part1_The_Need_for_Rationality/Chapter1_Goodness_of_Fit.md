# Chapter 1: Goodness of Fit

## Chapter Overview
This opening chapter establishes the fundamental framework for understanding design as a problem of achieving fit between form and context, introducing the concept of misfit variables as the key to systematic design analysis.

## Main Content

### The Form-Context Duality
- Every design problem involves creating a form that fits within a context
- **Form**: The part of the world we have control over (the design solution)
- **Context**: The part of the world that puts demands on the form (the problem environment)
- Good fit exists when form and context work together without friction or misfit
- The boundary between form and context defines the scope of the design problem

### The Concept of Misfit
- Good fit is characterized by the absence of misfits rather than presence of positive qualities
- Misfits are specific, identifiable failures in the form-context relationship
- Examples: A kettle that burns hands (misfit with safety requirements), a door too narrow for furniture (misfit with functional needs)
- Easier to identify what's wrong than to specify what's right
- Design process becomes elimination of misfits rather than creation of positive qualities

### The Ensemble
- The form and context together create an "ensemble" - a unified whole
- Good design achieves an effortless, frictionless ensemble
- The designer's task is to create form that completes the ensemble harmoniously
- Success is measured by the absence of incongruities or misfits in the ensemble

## Key Points
- Design is fundamentally about achieving fit between form and context
- Good fit is better understood through absence of negatives (misfits) than presence of positives
- The form-context boundary defines and limits the design problem
- Systematic design requires identifying and eliminating specific misfits
