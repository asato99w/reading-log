# Chapter 3: The Self-conscious Process

## Chapter Overview
This chapter analyzes the problems of modern deliberate design, showing how the loss of traditional methods and the complexity of contemporary problems make individual intuition inadequate for achieving good design.

## Main Content
- **Loss of Traditional Methods**
  - Breakdown of cultural continuity in rapidly changing societies
  - Separation of designers from users and builders
  - Loss of immediate feedback mechanisms that corrected misfits
  - Academic design education replacing apprenticeship learning

- **The Individual Designer's Predicament**
  - Single minds must solve problems previously handled by cultural evolution
  - Conceptual models in designer's head often wrong or incomplete
  - No direct experience of failure consequences
  - Pressure to create novel solutions rather than adapt existing ones

- **Problems of Self-conscious Design**
  - Delay between design decisions and performance feedback
  - Complexity exceeds individual cognitive capacity
  - Designer's personal vision may not match user needs
  - Fashion and theory replace practical problem-solving

## Key Points
- Modern design problems are too complex for individual intuition alone
- Loss of cultural feedback mechanisms removes natural error correction
- Self-conscious designers work from mental models that are often inaccurate
