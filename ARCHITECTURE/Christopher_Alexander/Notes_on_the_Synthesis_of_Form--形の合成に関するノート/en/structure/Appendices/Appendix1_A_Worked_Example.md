# Appendix 1: A Worked Example

## Chapter Overview
This appendix presents a complete application of Alexander's methodology through the analysis of an Indian village (Bavra, Gujarat), demonstrating the systematic decomposition of 141 misfit variables into a hierarchical design structure.

## Main Content
- **The Indian Village Case Study**
  - Complete analysis of Bavra village in Gujarat, India
  - Documentation of traditional settlement patterns
  - Identification of 141 specific misfit variables
  - Cultural context and environmental constraints

- **Application of the Method**
  - Step-by-step decomposition of the village requirements
  - Mathematical analysis of variable relationships
  - Hierarchical clustering of related requirements
  - Creation of tree structure showing subsystem organization

- **From Requirements to Patterns**
  - Translation of abstract clusters into spatial patterns
  - Relationship between requirement groups and physical layout
  - Demonstration of how diagrams generate actual settlement forms
  - Validation of method through comparison with actual village

## Key Points
- Complete methodology demonstrated through real-world example
- 141 variables successfully organized into coherent hierarchical structure
- Traditional settlement patterns can be understood through systematic analysis
