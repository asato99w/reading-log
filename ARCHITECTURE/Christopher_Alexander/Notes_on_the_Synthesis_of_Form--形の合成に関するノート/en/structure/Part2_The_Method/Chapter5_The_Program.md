# Chapter 5: The Program

## Chapter Overview
This chapter introduces the systematic method for design by establishing how to identify and organize all requirements into a formal program that can be mathematically analyzed.

## Main Content
- **Systematic Problem Definition**
  - Complete enumeration of all design requirements
  - Identification of specific misfit variables
  - Translation from intuitive to explicit requirements
  - Creation of requirement sets for analysis

- **From Intuition to Analysis**
  - Moving beyond vague design goals to specific criteria
  - Making implicit requirements explicit and testable
  - Establishing measurable performance standards
  - Creating objective basis for design evaluation

- **The Role of Requirements**
  - Requirements as constraints that define acceptable solutions
  - Misfit variables as specific failure modes to avoid
  - Relationship between requirements and form possibilities
  - Foundation for mathematical representation

## Key Points
- All design requirements must be explicitly identified before analysis
- Vague intuitive goals must be translated into specific, testable criteria
- The program forms the foundation for systematic design methods
