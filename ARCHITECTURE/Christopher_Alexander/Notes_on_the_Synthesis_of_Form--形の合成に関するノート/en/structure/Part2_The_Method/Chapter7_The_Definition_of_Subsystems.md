# Chapter 7: The Definition of Subsystems

## Chapter Overview
This chapter presents the core algorithmic method for decomposing complex design problems into manageable independent subsystems through hierarchical analysis.

## Main Content
- **Hierarchical Decomposition**
  - Breaking complex problems into smaller independent parts
  - Creating tree structures from graph representations
  - Identifying natural clusters of related requirements
  - Recursive application of decomposition method

- **Graph Partitioning Methods**
  - Mathematical algorithms for finding optimal clusters
  - Minimizing interactions between subsystems
  - Maximizing internal coherence within subsystems
  - Objective criteria for evaluating decomposition quality

- **Independence and Interaction**
  - Goal of creating functionally independent subsystems
  - Managing unavoidable interactions between subsystems
  - Trade-offs between independence and system integration
  - Hierarchical organization of subsystem relationships

## Key Points
- Complex problems must be decomposed into manageable independent parts
- Mathematical algorithms can find optimal decomposition structures
- Minimizing interactions between subsystems reduces design complexity
