# Chapter 6: The Realization of the Program

## Chapter Overview
This chapter presents the mathematical framework for representing design problems using set theory and graph theory to make the structure of complex problems visible and analyzable.

## Main Content
- **Set Theory Application**
  - Design requirements represented as sets of misfit variables
  - Relationships between variables as set intersections
  - Formal mathematical notation for design problems
  - Boolean operations on requirement sets

- **Graph Theory Representation**
  - Requirements as nodes in a graph structure
  - Interactions as edges connecting related variables
  - Visualization of problem complexity through graph diagrams
  - Graph properties revealing problem structure

- **Measuring Design Complexity**
  - Quantifying the difficulty of design problems
  - Information theory applied to design decisions
  - Complexity metrics for comparing alternative approaches
  - Mathematical basis for design optimization

## Key Points
- Mathematical representation makes invisible relationships visible
- Set theory and graph theory provide formal tools for design analysis
- Complexity can be measured and compared quantitatively
