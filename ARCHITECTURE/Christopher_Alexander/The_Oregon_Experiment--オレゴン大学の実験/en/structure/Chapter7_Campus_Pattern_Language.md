# Chapter 7: The Campus Pattern Language

## Chapter Overview
This chapter presents the specific patterns developed for university environments, demonstrating how abstract pattern language concepts translate into practical design solutions for campus planning and building design.

## Main Content
- **Site-Scale Patterns**
  - Campus as a whole should feel like a coherent place with clear boundaries
  - Major gathering spaces should be centrally located and easily accessible
  - Pedestrian circulation should follow natural desire lines and connect key destinations
  - Parking should be located at campus edges to preserve pedestrian-friendly core areas

- **Building-Scale Patterns**
  - Building entrances should provide clear transition from public to private space
  - Common spaces should be located where they naturally encourage social interaction
  - Classrooms and offices should have access to natural light and views
  - Building materials should be durable, maintainable, and appropriate to local climate

- **Detail-Scale Patterns**
  - Seating should be provided in outdoor spaces to encourage lingering and conversation
  - Walking surfaces should be safe, comfortable, and weather-appropriate
  - Lighting should provide security while creating pleasant evening environments
  - Landscaping should integrate buildings with natural site features

## Key Points
- Campus patterns address specific university needs while connecting to universal design principles
- Patterns work at multiple scales from site planning to construction details
- Successful patterns solve recurring problems while allowing contextual adaptation
