# Chapter 3: Piecemeal Growth

## Chapter Overview
This chapter presents the strategy of incremental development through small projects rather than large-scale construction, demonstrating how piecemeal growth enables adaptation, reduces risk, and maintains financial feasibility.

## Main Content
- **Small Project Strategy**
  - Individual projects should be small enough to manage effectively
  - Multiple small projects enable experimentation and learning
  - Mistakes in small projects have limited negative consequences
  - Success in small projects can be replicated and scaled up

- **Financial and Risk Benefits**
  - Smaller projects require less upfront capital investment
  - Costs can be spread over time rather than concentrated
  - Financial risk is distributed across multiple projects
  - Projects can be funded incrementally as resources become available

- **Learning and Adaptation**
  - Each project provides lessons for subsequent projects
  - Designs can be tested and refined through actual use
  - User feedback can inform design improvements over time
  - Mistakes can be corrected in future projects

## Key Points
- Small, incremental projects reduce financial risk while enabling continuous learning
- Piecemeal growth allows adaptation to changing conditions and user needs
- Multiple small projects create more opportunities for user participation and control
