# Chapter 4: Patterns

## Chapter Overview
This chapter introduces pattern language as a systematic approach to recurring design problems, providing tested solutions that can be adapted to specific contexts while maintaining their essential problem-solving character.

## Main Content
- **Pattern Language Concept**
  - Common design problems have recurring solutions that can be systematically identified
  - Patterns capture successful solutions in a form that enables adaptation to new contexts
  - Pattern languages provide coherent systems of interconnected design solutions
  - Patterns can be applied at multiple scales from site planning to construction details

- **Pattern Development Process**
  - Patterns are identified through observation of successful existing environments
  - Each pattern is tested and refined through practical application
  - User feedback validates pattern effectiveness in real-world conditions
  - Patterns evolve through use while maintaining their core problem-solving logic

- **Campus-Specific Pattern Applications**
  - Outdoor rooms that create comfortable gathering spaces
  - Building entrances that provide clear transition from exterior to interior
  - Circulation networks that connect different campus areas naturally
  - Flexible interior spaces that can adapt to changing use patterns

## Key Points
- Patterns provide systematic solutions to recurring design problems
- Pattern languages enable design quality while allowing contextual adaptation
- Campus patterns address specific university needs while connecting to broader design principles
