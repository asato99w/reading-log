# The Oregon Experiment - オレゴン大学の実験

Reading log for Christopher Alexander and colleagues' groundbreaking 1975 work "The Oregon Experiment"

## Overview
This seminal work documents the first large-scale practical application of Alexander's pattern language theory through the actual planning and development of the University of Oregon campus. It presents an alternative to traditional master planning through organic, participatory development processes.

## Key Concepts
- **Six Fundamental Principles**: Organic order, participation, piecemeal growth, patterns, diagnosis, and coordination
- **Participatory Design**: Revolutionary involvement of users (students, faculty, staff) as active design participants
- **Pattern Language Application**: Real-world testing and refinement of theoretical pattern concepts
- **Organic Growth**: Incremental development following natural growth patterns rather than comprehensive master plans
- **Diagnosis and Adaptation**: Continuous evaluation and adjustment of campus development

## Structure
- **English Version**: Complete analysis of theoretical principles, practical implementation, and case studies
- **Japanese Version**: オレゴン大学の実験 - Full bilingual examination of participatory campus planning methods
- **10 Main Chapters**: From theoretical foundation through specific project implementation and evaluation

## Historical Significance
- First major practical test of pattern language theory in real construction
- Pioneering example of participatory design methodology in institutional settings
- Revolutionary alternative to modernist comprehensive planning approaches
- Influential model for sustainable and democratic development processes
- Bridge between Alexander's theoretical work and later pattern language publications

## Contemporary Relevance
- Participatory planning and community engagement methods
- Sustainable campus development and green building practices
- Agile and iterative development processes (parallels to software development)
- Resilient planning for climate change and institutional adaptation
- Democratic decision-making in institutional development
- Pattern-based design thinking in contemporary architecture and planning

## Long-term Impact
- Influenced participatory design movement worldwide
- Changed campus planning practice from master plan to organic growth models
- Demonstrated viability of user-centered design processes
- Provided practical methods for democratic institutional development
- Established foundation for later sustainable design movements
