# Pattern 3: City Country Fingers

## Pattern Overview
Establishes the optimal interface between urban development and rural/natural areas through interlocking fingers of city and countryside.

## Context
Within a region where towns are distributed, there must be a clear relationship between built-up areas and open countryside that serves both urban and rural needs.

## Problem
**The problem**: Sharp boundaries between city and country create problems - either sprawl that consumes countryside, or urban areas cut off from nature.

**Forces at play**:
- People in cities need access to countryside for recreation and spiritual renewal
- Rural areas need access to urban facilities and markets
- Food production requires protection from urban encroachment
- Urban growth tends to sprawl uniformly outward
- Transportation corridors shape development patterns

## Solution
Create fingers of city reaching into the countryside and fingers of countryside reaching into the city. The city fingers contain the main urban development and transport corridors, while country fingers preserve agriculture, recreation, and natural systems.

## Key Elements
- **Urban fingers**: Dense development along major transport routes
- **Country fingers**: Agricultural land, forests, parks reaching into city
- **Finger width**: Country fingers at least 1 mile wide to maintain rural character
- **Access**: Easy movement between urban and rural fingers
- **Gradient**: Gradual transition from urban core to rural edge

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **1 Independent Regions**: Regional framework
- **2 The Distribution of Towns**: Town placement within regions

**Smaller patterns**:
- **4 Agricultural Valleys**: Food production areas
- **5 Lace of Country Streets**: Rural road networks
- **11 Local Transport Areas**: Public transportation systems

## Key Points
- Interlocking fingers prevent both sprawl and urban isolation from nature
- Transportation corridors naturally create urban fingers
- Country fingers must be wide enough to maintain rural character
