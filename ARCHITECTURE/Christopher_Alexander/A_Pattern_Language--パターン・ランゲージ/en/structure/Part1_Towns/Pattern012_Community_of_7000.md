# Pattern 12: Community of 7000

## Pattern Overview
Establishes the optimal size for a local community that can support both intimacy and diversity while maintaining democratic governance.

## Context
Within larger urban areas, people need to belong to identifiable communities that are small enough to be manageable but large enough to be vital.

## Problem
**The problem**: Communities that are too small lack diversity and facilities; communities that are too large become impersonal and unmanageable.

**Forces at play**:
- Small communities (under 1000) lack diversity and facilities
- Large communities (over 10,000) become anonymous and hard to govern
- People need to know their neighbors but also have choices
- Community facilities require minimum population to be viable
- Democratic participation works best in smaller groups

## Solution
Organize communities around populations of about 7000 people. This size supports enough diversity for interesting community life while remaining small enough for people to participate in local governance and know many of their neighbors.

## Key Elements
- **Population**: Approximately 5000-10,000 people, ideal around 7000
- **Facilities**: Can support elementary school, local shops, community center
- **Governance**: Size manageable for participatory democracy
- **Identity**: Small enough for shared identity and mutual recognition
- **Diversity**: Large enough for variety in people, activities, and services

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **2 The Distribution of Towns**: Regional organization
- **8 Mosaic of Subcultures**: Cultural diversity within regions

**Smaller patterns**:
- **14 Identifiable Neighborhood**: Smaller subdivisions within community
- **15 Neighborhood Boundary**: Defining community edges
- **16 Web of Public Transportation**: Connecting communities

## Key Points
- 7000 people can support essential community facilities
- Size allows for both intimacy and diversity
- Manageable scale for democratic participation and local governance
