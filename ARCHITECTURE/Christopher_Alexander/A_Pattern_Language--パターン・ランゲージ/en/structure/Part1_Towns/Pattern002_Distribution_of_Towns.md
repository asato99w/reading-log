# Pattern 2: The Distribution of Towns

## Pattern Overview
Establishes the optimal spacing and size relationships between towns within independent regions.

## Context
Within independent regions, people need access to both urban and rural environments, requiring a balanced distribution of settlements.

## Problem
**The problem**: Towns that are too close together compete destructively; towns that are too far apart leave large areas underserved and create excessive transportation needs.

**Forces at play**:
- Economic competition between nearby towns reduces vitality
- Isolated towns lack sufficient population for services
- Transportation costs increase with distance
- Rural areas need access to urban facilities
- Natural resources and geography constrain placement

## Solution
Distribute towns so that each town is surrounded by open countryside and is roughly equidistant from the next largest and smallest towns, with a natural hierarchy of settlement sizes.

## Key Elements
- **Town spacing**: Towns of similar size should be 10-20 miles apart
- **Size hierarchy**: Small towns (1,000), medium towns (7,000), large towns (50,000), cities (300,000)
- **Rural access**: All rural areas within reasonable distance of town services
- **Natural constraints**: Towns placed according to water, transport routes, and geography
- **Hinterlands**: Each town serves its surrounding agricultural/natural area

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **1 Independent Regions**: Regional organization framework

**Smaller patterns**:
- **3 City Country Fingers**: Urban-rural interface
- **4 Agricultural Valleys**: Food production areas
- **11 Local Transport Areas**: Movement between towns

## Key Points
- Proper town distribution prevents destructive competition
- Size hierarchy ensures access to different levels of services
- Natural spacing allows each town to serve its rural hinterland
