# Pattern 16: Web of Public Transportation

## Pattern Overview
Creates an interconnected network of public transportation that serves all parts of the region while supporting compact, walkable development.

## Context
Within regions containing multiple towns and neighborhoods, people need efficient ways to move between places without depending entirely on private automobiles.

## Problem
**The problem**: Car-dependent transportation creates sprawl, air pollution, and inequality; hub-and-spoke transit systems leave many areas poorly served; inadequate public transport forces car ownership.

**Forces at play**:
- People need mobility for work, services, and social connections
- Car dependence creates environmental and social problems
- Transit needs sufficient density to be economically viable
- Different trip types require different transportation modes
- Public transport must compete with car convenience
- Network effects make connected systems more valuable

## Solution
Create a web of public transportation that connects all neighborhoods and major destinations, with multiple routes and modes that allow people to travel efficiently without private cars.

## Key Elements
- **Network structure**: Multiple interconnected routes, not just hub-and-spoke
- **Multiple modes**: Buses, trains, light rail, cycling paths as appropriate
- **High frequency**: Regular service that people can rely on
- **Integration**: Seamless connections between different modes
- **Walkable access**: All areas within walking distance of transit stops
- **Development support**: Transit-oriented development around stops

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **2 The Distribution of Towns**: Regional transportation framework
- **3 City Country Fingers**: Connecting urban and rural areas

**Smaller patterns**:
- **17 Ring Roads**: Automobile circulation
- **20 Mini-Buses**: Local transportation
- **23 Parallel Roads**: Street hierarchy

## Key Points
- Web structure provides redundancy and multiple route options
- Integration between modes is essential for system effectiveness
- Transit must support and shape compact, walkable development patterns
