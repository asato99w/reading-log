# Pattern 1: Independent Regions

## Pattern Overview
The largest scale pattern establishing the fundamental organization of human settlement within bioregional boundaries.

## Context
Within a territory or nation, different regions have distinct geographic, climatic, and cultural characteristics that support different ways of life.

## Problem
**The problem**: Metropolitan areas become too large, centralized government becomes remote from local needs, and regions lose their distinct identity and self-sufficiency.

**Forces at play**:
- Economic concentration creates urban gigantism
- Political centralization reduces local autonomy
- Transportation systems favor large-scale organization
- Cultural homogenization erodes regional identity
- Environmental carrying capacity varies by region

## Solution
Create independent regions, each with a natural geographic boundary, population of 2-10 million, containing a full range of economic activities, and with its own government that has authority over all major economic and social decisions.

## Key Elements
- **Natural boundaries**: Mountain ranges, river valleys, or other geographic features
- **Population scale**: 2-10 million people per region  
- **Economic diversity**: Full range of primary, secondary, and tertiary activities
- **Political autonomy**: Regional government with significant authority
- **Cultural identity**: Distinct regional character and traditions

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**: None (this is the largest scale)
**Smaller patterns**: 
- **2 The Distribution of Towns**: How towns are arranged within regions
- **3 City Country Fingers**: The interface between urban and rural areas
- **4 Agricultural Valleys**: Food production areas within regions

## Key Points
- Independent regions create more sustainable and responsive governance
- Natural boundaries align human organization with ecological systems
- Regional diversity strengthens overall resilience and cultural richness
