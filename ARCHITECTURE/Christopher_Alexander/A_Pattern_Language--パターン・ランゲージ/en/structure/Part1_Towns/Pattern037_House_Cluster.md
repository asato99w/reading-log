# Pattern 37: House Cluster

## Pattern Overview
Groups houses together in small clusters that share common land and facilities while maintaining individual privacy and identity.

## Context
Within neighborhoods, individual houses need to relate to each other in ways that support both community interaction and family privacy.

## Problem
**The problem**: Isolated houses on individual lots prevent community formation; row houses can be too dense and uniform; suburban sprawl wastes land and resources; people need both privacy and community.

**Forces at play**:
- Families want private outdoor space and individual identity
- Children need safe play areas and contact with other children  
- Adults benefit from casual contact with neighbors
- Shared facilities can be more efficient than individual ones
- Common land can be better maintained than scattered private yards
- Cars and services need access without dominating

## Solution
Arrange houses in clusters of 8-12 houses around shared common land, with individual gardens and shared community facilities.

## Key Elements
- **Cluster size**: 8-12 houses for optimal community formation
- **Common land**: Shared green space at the center of each cluster
- **Individual gardens**: Private outdoor space for each house
- **Parking**: Cars accommodated but not dominating the cluster
- **Shared facilities**: Community buildings, play areas, or workshops
- **Pedestrian priority**: Safe walking paths connecting houses

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **14 Identifiable Neighborhood**: Neighborhood organization
- **35 Household Mix**: Diversity of household types

**Smaller patterns**:
- **40 Old People Everywhere**: Integration of different age groups
- **67 Common Land**: Shared outdoor spaces
- **106 Positive Outdoor Space**: Garden and yard design

## Key Points
- Small clusters enable community formation while preserving privacy
- Shared common land creates focus and reduces individual maintenance
- Design must balance individual identity with collective harmony
