# Pattern 30: Activity Nodes

## Pattern Overview
Concentrates community facilities and commercial activities at transportation intersections to create lively centers that serve neighborhoods efficiently.

## Context
Within identifiable neighborhoods and communities, people need convenient access to services, shops, and community facilities.

## Problem
**The problem**: Scattered facilities are inconvenient and cannot support each other; centralized facilities may be too remote from residential areas; dead zones without activity lack safety and vitality.

**Forces at play**:
- People want convenience and walkable access to services
- Businesses benefit from clustering and foot traffic
- Transit systems work best with concentrated destinations
- Community life needs gathering places
- Activities support each other through proximity
- Some quiet residential areas are desirable

## Solution
Create nodes of activity at the intersections of paths, roads, and transit lines, where community facilities, shops, and services can cluster together and support each other.

## Key Elements
- **Transportation intersections**: Located where people naturally pass through
- **Mixed activities**: Combination of commercial, civic, and social facilities
- **Pedestrian focus**: Designed for walking, not just automobile access
- **Multiple scales**: Nodes appropriate to neighborhood, community, and city levels
- **Gradual edges**: Activity intensity diminishes gradually toward residential areas
- **Public space**: Squares, plazas, or parks at the center of nodes

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **14 Identifiable Neighborhood**: Neighborhood structure
- **16 Web of Public Transportation**: Transit connections

**Smaller patterns**:
- **31 Promenade**: Pedestrian pathways
- **58 Carnival**: Celebration spaces
- **61 Small Public Squares**: Gathering spaces at nodes

## Key Points
- Activity concentration at intersections maximizes accessibility and synergy
- Nodes should serve multiple scales from local to regional needs
- Public space at the center creates heart of community life
