# Pattern 61: Small Public Squares

## Pattern Overview
Creates intimate public gathering spaces that serve as social hearts for neighborhoods and communities.

## Context
Within activity nodes and neighborhood centers, people need places to meet, sit, and watch the life of the community go by.

## Problem
**The problem**: Large public squares often feel empty and impersonal; areas without public space lack community focus; people need places for casual social interaction; commercial areas without gathering spaces feel purely transactional.

**Forces at play**:
- People enjoy watching other people and street life
- Informal social contact strengthens communities  
- Public space provides neutral territory for all residents
- Activities around squares make them feel safe and lively
- Too large spaces feel empty; too small spaces feel cramped
- Weather protection encourages year-round use

## Solution
Create small public squares at the heart of communities and neighborhoods, surrounded by shops and community facilities, designed for sitting and social interaction.

## Key Elements
- **Intimate scale**: 45-60 feet across, comfortable for conversation
- **Surrounding activities**: Shops, cafes, or community buildings facing the square
- **Seating**: Built-in benches and sitting walls around the edges
- **Partial enclosure**: Buildings creating sense of outdoor room
- **Weather protection**: Trees, awnings, or arcades for comfort
- **Central focus**: Fountain, sculpture, or tree as gathering point
