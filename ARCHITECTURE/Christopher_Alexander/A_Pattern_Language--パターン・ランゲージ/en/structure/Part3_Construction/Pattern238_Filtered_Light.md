# Pattern 238: Filtered Light

## Pattern Overview
Creates gentle, diffused natural light that avoids harsh contrasts while providing adequate illumination for comfortable seeing and pleasant ambiance.

## Context
Throughout buildings, natural light needs to be controlled and modified to create comfortable conditions for different activities and times of day.

## Problem
**The problem**: Direct sunlight creates glare and harsh shadows; unfiltered light causes eye strain and visual discomfort; uniform artificial lighting lacks the variety and quality of natural light; people prefer soft, varied illumination.

**Forces at play**:
- Direct sunlight is often too bright and creates harsh contrasts
- People prefer gradual transitions from light to dark areas
- Different activities require different light quality and quantity
- Natural light changes throughout the day and seasons
- Filtering systems must still provide adequate illumination
- Light quality affects mood and psychological comfort

## Solution
Filter natural light through various means - overhangs, lattices, translucent materials, reflected surfaces - to create gentle, diffused illumination throughout buildings.

## Key Elements
- **Light filtering devices**: Overhangs, screens, lattices, shutters, awnings
- **Translucent materials**: Frosted glass, fabric panels, rice paper screens
- **Reflected light**: Light bounced off walls, ceilings, and exterior surfaces
- **Gradual transitions**: Avoid sharp boundaries between light and dark areas
- **Variety**: Different degrees and qualities of filtering for different spaces
- **Seasonal adaptation**: Systems that adjust to changing sun angles

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **159 Light on Two Sides**: Multiple light sources for better distribution
- **194 Interior Windows**: Sharing filtered light between spaces

**Smaller patterns**:
- **240 Half-Inch Trim**: Details that filter and control light
- **248 Soft Tile and Brick**: Materials that provide gentle light reflection
- **250 Warm Colors**: Color palettes that work with filtered light

## Key Points
- Filtered light is more comfortable and pleasant than direct sunlight or uniform artificial light
- Light filtering should provide variety while maintaining adequate illumination levels
- Natural filtering systems can adapt to changing conditions throughout the day and year
