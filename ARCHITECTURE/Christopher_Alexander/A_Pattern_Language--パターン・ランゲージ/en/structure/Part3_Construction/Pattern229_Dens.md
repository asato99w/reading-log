# Pattern 229: Dens

## Pattern Overview
Creates small, enclosed, cave-like spaces within larger rooms where people can retreat for privacy, intimacy, and psychological comfort.

## Context
Within homes and buildings, people need spaces of different scales, including very small, enclosed areas where they can be alone or have intimate conversations.

## Problem
**The problem**: Large, open rooms don't provide psychological refuge; people need places to withdraw and feel protected; children especially need small spaces they can claim as their own; intimate activities require appropriate-sized spaces.

**Forces at play**:
- People need variety in spatial scale from large to very small
- Psychological comfort often requires enclosure and protection
- Children naturally create forts, hideouts, and secret places
- Intimate conversations need small, enclosed spaces
- Very small spaces can feel cozy rather than cramped when designed well
- Den-like spaces provide refuge from social demands

## Solution
Create small, partially enclosed spaces - alcoves, nooks, spaces under stairs or lofts - that feel like dens where people can retreat for privacy and intimacy.

## Key Elements
- **Small scale**: Space for 1-2 people maximum, intimate proportions
- **Partial enclosure**: Three sides enclosed, one side open to larger space
- **Low ceiling**: 6-7 feet high to enhance feeling of shelter
- **Built-in seating**: Benches, cushions, or window seats
- **Good light**: Natural light from small windows or borrowed light
- **Personal territory**: Space that can be claimed and personalized
