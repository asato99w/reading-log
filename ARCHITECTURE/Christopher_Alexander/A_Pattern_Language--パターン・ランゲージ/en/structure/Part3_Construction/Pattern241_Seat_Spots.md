# Pattern 241: Seat Spots

## Pattern Overview
Provides comfortable seating locations throughout buildings and outdoor spaces where people naturally want to sit and rest.

## Context
Throughout any environment where people spend time, there are locations that naturally call for seating - places with good views, comfortable conditions, or natural stopping points.

## Problem
**The problem**: Many potentially pleasant seating locations go unused because there's no actual place to sit; uncomfortable seating discourages use of otherwise good locations; people need variety in seating options and locations.

**Forces at play**:
- People naturally gravitate to certain locations for sitting
- Good seating locations have specific qualities: views, shelter, comfort, social connection
- Different activities require different types of seating
- Seating should be available when and where people want it
- Both planned and spontaneous seating is valuable
- Maintenance and durability affect long-term usefulness

## Solution
Create comfortable seating wherever people might naturally want to sit - by windows, in gardens, at path intersections, overlooking activity, in private corners.

## Key Elements
- **Strategic placement**: At natural stopping points, view locations, activity edges
- **Comfortable dimensions**: Appropriate height, depth, and back support
- **Variety of types**: Benches, chairs, built-in seating, informal perching spots
- **Weather protection**: Shelter from rain, wind, and excessive sun
- **Social options**: Both solitary seating and group seating opportunities
- **Integration**: Seating that fits naturally into its setting
