# Pattern 205: Structure Follows Social Spaces

## Pattern Overview
Organizes the structural system of buildings to support and reinforce the social organization of spaces rather than imposing structural logic on human activities.

## Context
When designing the structural system for any building, there's a choice between letting structure determine spatial layout or letting spatial needs determine structural arrangement.

## Problem
**The problem**: Structural systems that ignore social organization create awkward spaces and force human activities into structurally convenient but socially inappropriate configurations; grid systems often create uniform spaces that don't match varied human needs.

**Forces at play**:
- Social activities need spaces of different sizes and shapes
- Structural efficiency often conflicts with optimal social arrangements
- Load-bearing requirements must be met regardless of social needs
- Uniform structural systems create uniform spaces
- Flexibility for future changes requires structural adaptability
- Economic efficiency encourages structural regularity

## Solution
Design the structural system to reinforce the social organization of spaces, placing major structural elements to support the most important social boundaries and spatial relationships.

## Key Elements
- **Social space priority**: Layout spaces for human activities first, then design structure
- **Major structural elements**: Walls, columns, beams coincide with important social boundaries
- **Minor adjustments**: Use non-structural elements for fine-tuning spatial needs
- **Structural hierarchy**: Major and minor structural elements support major and minor spaces
- **Future flexibility**: Structure allows for reasonable changes in spatial organization
- **Integration**: Structure and space work together, not against each other

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **95 Building Complex**: Overall building organization informing structure
- **129 Common Areas at the Heart**: Central spaces requiring structural support

**Smaller patterns**:
- **206 Efficient Structure**: Achieving structural efficiency within social organization
- **208 Gradual Stiffening**: Structural system that can adapt over time
- **213 Final Column Distribution**: Specific placement of structural columns

## Key Points
- Structure should support social organization, not determine it
- Major structural elements should coincide with major social boundaries
- Structural systems can reinforce spatial hierarchy and social relationships
