# Pattern 249: Ornament

## Pattern Overview
Integrates meaningful decoration and ornamental elements into buildings to create beauty, express human care, and connect built environments to cultural traditions.

## Context
Buildings need elements that go beyond pure function to create beauty, express meaning, and demonstrate human care and craftsmanship.

## Problem
**The problem**: Purely functional buildings often feel cold and inhuman; applied decoration can seem superficial or fake; expensive ornament may be wasteful; mass-produced ornament lacks meaning and authenticity.

**Forces at play**:
