# Pattern 214: Root Foundations

## Pattern Overview
Creates foundation systems that spread loads gradually into the ground like tree roots, allowing buildings to adapt to site conditions and grow incrementally.

## Context
Every building needs a foundation system that transfers loads from the structure to the ground while dealing with varying soil conditions and potential for future additions.

## Problem
**The problem**: Conventional foundations are often over-engineered; monolithic foundation systems cannot adapt to varying ground conditions; foundations that cannot accommodate additions limit building growth; expensive foundations may be unnecessary for simple buildings.

**Forces at play**:
- Different soil conditions require different foundation strategies
- Building loads vary across the structure
- Future additions need foundation connections
- Foundation work is expensive and permanent
- Ground conditions may not be fully known until construction begins
- Some buildings need minimal foundations while others require substantial ones

## Solution
Create foundation systems that spread loads gradually into the ground through multiple points, like tree roots, allowing adaptation to ground conditions and incremental growth.

## Key Elements
- **Distributed support**: Multiple foundation points rather than continuous footings
- **Gradual load transfer**: Loads spread through branching foundation elements
- **Site adaptation**: Foundation elements sized for actual soil conditions
- **Connection points**: Provisions for future foundation extensions
- **Minimal intervention**: Only as much foundation as actually needed
- **Natural materials**: Stone, gravel, and other materials that integrate with ground

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **104 Site Repair**: Foundations that work with site conditions
- **208 Gradual Stiffening**: Foundations as part of gradual building development

**Smaller patterns**:
- **215 Ground Floor Slab**: Floor systems that work with root foundations
- **220 Roof Vaults**: Upper structure supported by foundation system
- **247 Paving with Cracks**: Ground surfaces that relate to foundation points

## Key Points
- Foundations should adapt to actual ground conditions rather than imposing uniform systems
- Distributed foundation points allow for incremental building growth
- Foundation investment should match building permanence and loads
