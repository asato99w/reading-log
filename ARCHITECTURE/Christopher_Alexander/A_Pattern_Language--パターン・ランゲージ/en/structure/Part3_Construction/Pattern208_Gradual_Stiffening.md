# Pattern 208: Gradual Stiffening

## Pattern Overview
Builds structures that start with flexible, lightweight systems and gradually become more permanent and rigid as the building and its uses stabilize over time.

## Context
Buildings need to adapt and change over time, but they also need structural stability and permanence for long-term durability.

## Problem
**The problem**: Permanent structures built all at once cannot adapt to changing needs; temporary structures lack stability and durability; people cannot predict exactly how buildings will be used over time.

**Forces at play**:
- Building uses and needs change over time
- Structural investment should match certainty of use
- Flexibility costs more initially but saves money over building lifetime
- Some structural elements are harder to change than others
- People learn how they want to use spaces by living in them
- Premature commitment to rigid structure wastes resources

## Solution
Begin with lightweight, flexible structural systems and gradually make them more rigid and permanent as the building's use patterns become clear and stable.

## Key Elements
- **Initial flexibility**: Start with lightweight, movable, or temporary structural elements
- **Gradual commitment**: Make permanent structural decisions over time as needs clarify
- **Reversible decisions**: Early structural choices can be undone or modified
- **Learning period**: Allow time for users to discover how they want to use spaces
- **Selective permanence**: Make some elements permanent while keeping others flexible
- **Structural hierarchy**: Different elements stiffen at different rates

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **205 Structure Follows Social Spaces**: Structural adaptation to social organization
- **206 Efficient Structure**: Balancing efficiency with adaptability

**Smaller patterns**:
- **213 Final Column Distribution**: Gradual refinement of column placement
- **214 Root Foundations**: Foundation systems that can grow over time
- **215 Ground Floor Slab**: Flexible floor systems

## Key Points
- Buildings should become more rigid gradually as their uses become more certain
- Initial structural systems should emphasize adaptability over permanence
- Structural decisions should be reversible until use patterns are well established
