# Pattern 246: Climbing Plants

## Pattern Overview
Uses climbing plants to soften building exteriors, create natural cooling, provide privacy screening, and integrate buildings with their natural surroundings.

## Context
Buildings often need softening, screening, cooling, or integration with landscape, and the vertical surfaces of buildings provide opportunities for plant growth.

## Problem
**The problem**: Building walls can be harsh, institutional, or unwelcoming; buildings often lack connection to natural systems; mechanical cooling systems are energy-intensive; privacy screening with artificial materials feels cold and institutional.

**Forces at play**:
- Plants naturally soften and humanize building surfaces
- Climbing plants provide cooling through evapotranspiration and shading
- Vertical plant surfaces require less ground space than trees or shrubs
- Plants change with seasons, providing variety and natural beauty
- Some climbing plants can damage building materials
- Plant maintenance requires ongoing care and attention

## Solution
Use climbing plants on building walls, fences, and structures to create natural softening, cooling, screening, and integration with the landscape.

## Key Elements
- **Appropriate species**: Plants that won't damage building materials
- **Support structures**: Trellises, wires, or frames for plant support
- **Planned locations**: Strategic placement for cooling, screening, or softening effects
- **Maintenance access**: Ability to care for plants and maintain building surfaces
- **Seasonal variety**: Mix of evergreen and deciduous plants for year-round interest
- **Building integration**: Support systems integrated with building design

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **104 Site Repair**: Plants as part of site healing and improvement
- **106 Positive Outdoor Space**: Plants helping to define outdoor rooms

**Smaller patterns**:
- **241 Seat Spots**: Plants providing comfort and beauty around seating
- **247 Paving with Cracks**: Ground surfaces that integrate with plant growth
- **248 Soft Tile and Brick**: Building materials that work well with plants

## Key Points
- Climbing plants provide multiple benefits: cooling, softening, screening, beauty
- Plant selection must consider building materials and maintenance requirements
- Integration of plants and buildings requires planning and ongoing care
