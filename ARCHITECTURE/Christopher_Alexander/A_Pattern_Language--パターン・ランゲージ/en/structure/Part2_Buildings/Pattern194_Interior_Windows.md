# Pattern 194: Interior Windows

## Pattern Overview
Creates windows between interior spaces to share light, views, and spatial connection while maintaining acoustic and functional separation.

## Context
Within buildings where some rooms receive abundant natural light while others are darker, and where spaces need both connection and separation.

## Problem
**The problem**: Interior rooms often lack natural light; solid walls between spaces create complete isolation; borrowed light through doorways is insufficient; some rooms need light but not direct access.

**Forces at play**:
- Natural light is valuable and should be shared where possible
- People prefer visual connection between related spaces
- Privacy and acoustic separation are still needed between some areas
- Air circulation improves with interior openings
- Spatial flow is enhanced by visual connections
- Children and family members benefit from visual contact across spaces

## Solution
Use interior windows to borrow light from light-rich areas and share it with darker spaces, while creating visual connection between related rooms.

## Key Elements
- **Light sharing**: Windows from bright rooms to darker adjacent spaces
- **Appropriate relationships**: Between related spaces (kitchen-dining, hall-living room)
- **Privacy control**: Frosted glass, shutters, or curtains when needed
- **Size and placement**: Large enough for significant light transfer
- **Acoustic separation**: Maintain sound barriers when required
- **Visual supervision**: Enable parents to watch children across spaces

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **159 Light on Two Sides**: Strategy for bringing light to all rooms
- **129 Common Areas at the Heart**: Central spaces sharing light with adjacent areas

**Smaller patterns**:
- **238 Filtered Light**: Quality of light passing through interior windows
- **249 Ornament**: Decorative treatment of interior window frames and glazing

## Key Points
- Interior windows multiply the value of natural light by sharing it
- Visual connections between spaces enhance both privacy and openness
- Acoustic separation can be maintained while sharing light and views
