# Pattern 124: Activity Pockets

## Pattern Overview
Creates small, partially enclosed spaces around the edges of larger rooms and outdoor areas where specific activities can take place comfortably.

## Context
Within larger public spaces, both indoor and outdoor, people need smaller areas where they can engage in specific activities without feeling exposed or lost in the larger space.

## Problem
**The problem**: Large open spaces often feel uncomfortable because people have nowhere specific to settle; activities get lost in vast areas; people prefer to be near edges and corners but need variety in available spaces.

**Forces at play**:
- People feel more comfortable in spaces that are partially enclosed
- Different activities require different spatial qualities and equipment
- Large spaces need subdivision to feel human-scaled
- Edge conditions provide security and orientation
- Flexibility requires spaces that can accommodate various uses
- Social activities benefit from defined territories

## Solution
Create small pockets of space around the edges of larger areas, each designed for specific activities, partially enclosed by changes in level, overhead plane, or low walls.

## Key Elements
- **Edge location**: Positioned around the perimeter of larger spaces
- **Partial enclosure**: Defined by level changes, overhangs, or low partitions
- **Activity-specific**: Designed for particular uses (reading, conversation, play)
- **Variety**: Multiple pockets offering different spatial qualities
- **Visual connection**: Maintains relationship with larger space
- **Appropriate scale**: Sized for intended activities and number of people
