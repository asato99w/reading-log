# Pattern 104: Site Repair

## Pattern Overview
Positions new buildings to heal and improve damaged or problematic sites rather than simply accommodating existing conditions.

## Context
When building on any site, whether urban or rural, virgin or developed, there are always opportunities to improve the site's relationship to its surroundings and natural systems.

## Problem
**The problem**: New buildings often ignore site problems or even make them worse; beautiful sites can be destroyed by insensitive development; damaged sites remain damaged if buildings simply work around problems.

**Forces at play**:
- Most sites have been damaged by previous inappropriate development
- Building placement can either heal or further damage natural systems
- Views, sun, wind, and water patterns should be enhanced, not blocked
- Existing vegetation and wildlife habitats deserve protection
- Slopes, drainage, and soil conditions affect both building and landscape
- Community connections can be strengthened or severed by building placement

## Solution
Place buildings to repair the site - healing damaged areas, enhancing positive features, and creating better relationships between the site and its surroundings.

## Key Elements
- **Damage assessment**: Identify and understand existing site problems
- **Enhancement opportunities**: Find ways to improve natural and social systems
- **Strategic placement**: Position buildings to solve problems, not create new ones
- **Landscape restoration**: Repair damaged ecosystems and drainage patterns
- **View creation**: Frame and enhance desirable views while screening problems
- **Microclimate improvement**: Use buildings to create better outdoor conditions

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **95 Building Complex**: Multi-building site organization
- **103 Small Parking Lots**: Vehicle accommodation without site damage

**Smaller patterns**:
- **105 South Facing Outdoors**: Solar orientation
- **106 Positive Outdoor Space**: Outdoor room creation
- **168 Connection to the Earth**: Ground-level relationships

## Key Points
- Every building project is an opportunity to improve its site
- Understanding site systems and problems is essential before design begins  
- Building placement should heal damage and enhance positive site features
