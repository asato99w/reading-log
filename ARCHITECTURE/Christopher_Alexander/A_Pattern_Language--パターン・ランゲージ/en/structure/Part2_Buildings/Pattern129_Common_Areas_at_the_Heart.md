# Pattern 129: Common Areas at the Heart

## Pattern Overview
Places shared facilities and gathering spaces at the center of buildings where they can be easily accessed and serve as the social heart of the community.

## Context
In any building that serves multiple people - whether housing, workplace, or institutional building - there are activities and facilities that need to be shared.

## Problem
**The problem**: Common facilities placed at the edge or in basements are underused; buildings without central gathering spaces lack community life; circulation that bypasses common areas prevents casual social interaction.

**Forces at play**:
- Shared facilities need central location for equal access by all users
- Casual encounters in common areas build community relationships
- Central location makes facilities visible and inviting
- Heart of building should be the most pleasant and well-lit space
- Common areas need to be secure but not isolated
- Different activities may conflict if poorly arranged

## Solution
Place common areas at the physical and social heart of buildings, where circulation paths naturally bring people past them and where they receive good natural light and pleasant conditions.

## Key Elements
- **Central location**: At the intersection of major circulation routes
- **Visibility**: Easily seen from entrances and primary pathways
- **Natural light**: Windows or skylights providing pleasant illumination
- **Flexible space**: Able to accommodate various activities and group sizes
- **Support facilities**: Kitchen, storage, restrooms nearby
- **Indoor-outdoor connection**: Access to outdoor common space when possible

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **95 Building Complex**: Organization of multiple buildings around common facilities
- **98 Circulation Realms**: Movement systems serving common areas

**Smaller patterns**:

- **142 Sequence of Sitting Spaces**: Variety of seating throughout common areas
- **159 Light on Two Sides**: Natural lighting for common spaces

## Key Points
- Central location ensures common facilities are seen and used by everyone
- Heart of building should be the most attractive and pleasant space
- Circulation patterns should naturally bring people through common areas
