# Pattern 140: Private Terrace on the Street

## Pattern Overview
Provides each ground-floor dwelling with its own private outdoor space that connects directly to the street while maintaining privacy and identity.

## Context
In urban housing where buildings face streets, residents need private outdoor space that allows them to be part of street life while having their own territory.

## Problem
**The problem**: Ground-floor apartments without private outdoor space feel cut off from nature and street life; public sidewalks don't provide personal territory; back yards may be dark and isolated from community life.

**Forces at play**:
- People want private outdoor space connected to their homes
- Ground-floor residents can enhance street life through their presence
- Privacy is needed even in urban settings
- Children need safe outdoor play space visible to parents
- Gardens and plants improve both private and public environments
- Territory boundaries need clear definition

## Solution
Give every ground-floor home its own private piece of outdoor space, raised slightly above the street level and defined by walls or planting, but still connected to street life.

## Key Elements
- **Level change**: Terrace raised 2-4 feet above sidewalk for privacy
- **Clear boundaries**: Low walls, hedges, or fences defining private space
- **Street connection**: Visual and social connection to public sidewalk
- **Appropriate size**: Large enough for sitting, gardening, children's play
- **Direct access**: Door from main living space to terrace
- **Plant-friendly**: Soil and conditions supporting gardens and trees

- Ground-floor homes with terraces enliven and secure streets
