# Pattern 95: Building Complex

## Pattern Overview
Organizes individual buildings into coherent complexes that work together as unified environments while maintaining individual identity.

## Context
When several buildings need to work together - whether housing, offices, schools, or mixed-use developments - they must be arranged to support both individual function and collective harmony.

## Problem
**The problem**: Isolated buildings cannot share resources or create community; randomly placed buildings create chaos; monolithic buildings are inflexible and lack human scale.

**Forces at play**:
- Buildings need to share utilities, services, and facilities efficiently
- People benefit from variety and choice within unified environments
- Different functions require different building types and sizes
- Shared outdoor spaces need protection and definition
- Circulation must connect buildings logically
- Future changes and additions must be possible

## Solution
Create building complexes where individual buildings of different sizes and functions are arranged around shared outdoor spaces, connected by clear circulation paths, and designed to work together as a unified environment.

## Key Elements
- **Multiple buildings**: 3-12 individual structures rather than one large building
- **Shared outdoor space**: Courtyards, gardens, or plazas binding buildings together
- **Clear circulation**: Pedestrian paths connecting all buildings
- **Functional diversity**: Mix of building types serving different purposes
- **Unified character**: Consistent materials, scale, or design language
- **Growth potential**: Capacity for future additions and changes

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **37 House Cluster**: Residential clustering principles
- **83 Master and Apprentices**: Learning environments

**Smaller patterns**:
- **98 Circulation Realms**: Movement systems within complexes
- **106 Positive Outdoor Space**: Courtyard and garden design
- **114 Hierarchy of Open Space**: Organization of outdoor areas

## Key Points
- Multiple smaller buildings provide flexibility and human scale
- Shared outdoor space creates unity and community focus
- Design must balance individual identity with collective harmony
