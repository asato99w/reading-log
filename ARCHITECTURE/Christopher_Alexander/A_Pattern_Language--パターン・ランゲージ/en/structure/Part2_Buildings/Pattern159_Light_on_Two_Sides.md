# Pattern 159: Light on Two Sides

## Pattern Overview
Provides natural light from at least two sides of every room to create better illumination, ventilation, and spatial quality.

## Context
In any building, rooms need natural light for comfort, health, and connection to the outdoors.

## Problem
**The problem**: Rooms with light from only one side create harsh contrasts between light and dark areas; single-sided light limits furniture arrangement; people prefer rooms that are not too dark or too bright in any area.

**Forces at play**:
- Natural light from one side creates glare and deep shadows
- People want even, comfortable light throughout rooms
- Cross-ventilation requires openings on opposite or adjacent sides
- Views in multiple directions provide spatial orientation
- Single-sided rooms can feel tunnel-like or cave-like
- Building depth is constrained by natural light penetration

## Solution
Provide natural light on at least two sides of every room, and especially those rooms where people spend the most time.

## Key Elements
- **Two-sided lighting**: Windows, doors, or skylights on at least two walls
- **Adjacent or opposite**: Openings on walls that meet at corners or face each other
- **Primary rooms first**: Living rooms, bedrooms, workspaces get priority
- **Balanced light**: Avoid one dominant light source creating glare
- **View variety**: Different outlook directions from same room
- **Cross-ventilation**: Enable air movement through room
