# Pattern 202: Built-in Seats

## Pattern Overview
Integrates seating directly into the building structure to create comfortable, well-positioned places to sit that enhance the architecture and support daily activities.

## Context
Throughout buildings, people need comfortable places to sit that are positioned to take advantage of light, views, and activity, but movable furniture often cannot achieve optimal placement.

## Problem
**The problem**: Movable furniture cannot always be positioned optimally; the best seating locations (by windows, in alcoves, at activity edges) often go unused; rooms lack sufficient seating for gatherings; commercial seating is often uncomfortable or inappropriate.

**Forces at play**:
- The best seating locations are architectural, not furniture locations
- Built-in seats can be designed for specific views and light conditions
- Integrated seating saves space and defines areas
- People need variety in seating types and orientations
- Built-in seating can provide storage underneath
- Movable furniture still needed for flexibility

## Solution
Build seats into the structure of buildings in locations where people naturally want to sit - by windows, around fireplaces, at the edges of rooms, and in alcoves.

## Key Elements
- **Optimal locations**: Windows, fireplaces, room edges, alcoves, level changes
- **Comfortable dimensions**: 15-18 inch height, 18-24 inch depth, back support when needed
- **Variety of types**: Window seats, bench seating, corner nooks, alcove seating
- **Storage integration**: Use space beneath seats for storage
- **Material warmth**: Wood, upholstered surfaces, or warm stone
- **Supplementary seating**: Combine with movable chairs for flexibility

## Connected Patterns
**Larger patterns**:
- **124 Activity Pockets**: Built-in seats defining activity areas
- **180 Window Place**: Window seating as specific pattern application

**Smaller patterns**:
- **241 Seat Spots**: Individual comfortable seating locations
- **246 Climbing Plants**: Landscaping around outdoor built-in seating
- **251 Different Chairs**: Movable seating to supplement built-ins

## Key Points
- Best seating locations are architectural features, not furniture placement decisions
- Built-in seating should be positioned to take advantage of specific views and conditions
- Variety in built-in seating types supports different activities and preferences
