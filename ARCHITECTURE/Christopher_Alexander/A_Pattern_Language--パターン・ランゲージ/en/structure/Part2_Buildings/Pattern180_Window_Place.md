# Pattern 180: Window Place

## Pattern Overview
Creates comfortable places to sit by windows where people can look out, read, and enjoy natural light and views.

## Context
Around windows, especially in living rooms, bedrooms, and other spaces where people spend time, there's an opportunity to create particularly pleasant places to sit.

## Problem
**The problem**: Windows are often wasted as mere sources of light; people are drawn to windows but have no comfortable way to use them; the best light and views in rooms are not utilized for seating.

**Forces at play**:
- People naturally gravitate toward windows and light
- Windows provide both light for reading and views for relaxation
- Window areas are often the most pleasant spots in rooms
- Standard furniture doesn't take advantage of window locations
- Window seating needs to be comfortable for extended use
- Views and privacy considerations affect seating orientation

## Solution
Create built-in seating areas by windows, with space for people to sit comfortably and look out, positioned to take advantage of the best light and views.

## Key Elements
- **Built-in seating**: Window seats, benches, or alcoves integrated with window design
- **Comfortable dimensions**: Seat height 15-18 inches, depth 18-24 inches
- **Good light**: Position for reading light without glare
- **Storage beneath**: Use space under seats for storage
- **View orientation**: Face seating toward best views when possible
- **Privacy control**: Curtains or blinds for light and privacy control
