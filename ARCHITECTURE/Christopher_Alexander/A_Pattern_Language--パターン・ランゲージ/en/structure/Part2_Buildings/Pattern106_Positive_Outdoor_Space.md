# Pattern 106: Positive Outdoor Space

## Pattern Overview
Creates outdoor spaces that feel like outdoor rooms with clear shape and enclosure, rather than leftover space between buildings.

## Context
Around buildings and within building complexes, outdoor spaces are needed for recreation, social interaction, and connection to nature.

## Problem
**The problem**: Outdoor spaces that are merely leftover areas between buildings feel shapeless and uncomfortable; people avoid spaces that lack definition and enclosure; negative space cannot support outdoor activities.

**Forces at play**:
- People prefer outdoor spaces that feel protected and enclosed
- Shapeless outdoor areas lack identity and purpose
- Activities need spaces designed to support them
- Buildings create outdoor spaces by their placement and form
- Weather protection and sun access affect usability
- Visual connection between indoors and outdoors enhances both

## Solution
Create positive outdoor spaces that are shaped by buildings and feel like outdoor rooms, with at least 50% of their perimeter enclosed by buildings or walls.

## Key Elements
- **Clear shape**: Definite geometric form, usually rectangular or circular
- **Enclosure**: Buildings, walls, or dense planting defining at least half the perimeter
- **Human scale**: Size appropriate for intended activities (10-25 feet for intimate spaces)
- **Level changes**: Terraces or steps to create variety and definition
- **Weather protection**: Overhangs, trees, or walls providing shelter
- **Indoor-outdoor connection**: Windows and doors opening onto the space
