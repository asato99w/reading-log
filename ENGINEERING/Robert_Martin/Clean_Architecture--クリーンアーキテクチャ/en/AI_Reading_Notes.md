# AI Reading Notes: Clean Architecture

## AI Analysis Insights and Observations

### Key Learning Points
- **Architecture Independence**: Clean architecture decouples core business logic from external concerns like frameworks, databases, and UI, enabling systems to remain flexible and testable across technological changes.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Higher-level policies should not depend on lower-level details; instead, both should depend on abstractions, creating a stable architectural foundation that supports change.
- **Screaming Architecture**: System architecture should clearly communicate its purpose and domain, making business intent immediately visible rather than obscuring it with technical implementation details.

### Important Quotes
> "The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system."
> "Details are not architecture. Frameworks are details. Databases are details. The web is a detail."
