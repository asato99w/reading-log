# Chapter 24: Partial Boundaries

## Chapter Overview
This chapter discusses strategies for implementing incomplete architectural boundaries when full separation isn't initially justified but future flexibility is desired, balancing current needs with architectural options.

## Main Content

### When Partial Boundaries Make Sense
- Full architectural boundaries require significant effort and complexity that may not be initially justified
- Partial boundaries provide some benefits of separation while avoiding the full cost of complete isolation
- They preserve the option to implement full boundaries later when the need becomes clear
- Partial boundaries are appropriate when separation is anticipated but not immediately necessary

### Skip the Last Step Pattern
- Implement all boundary components (interfaces, data structures, dependency inversion) but deploy as a single component
- Maintain separate source modules but compile and deploy together
- This provides development-time separation while avoiding deployment complexity
- The boundary can be "promoted" to a full boundary by changing deployment configuration

### One-Dimensional Boundaries
- Use simple interfaces without reciprocal interfaces for simpler boundary crossing
- The Strategy pattern provides one-dimensional boundaries where clients depend on service interfaces
- Less isolation than full boundaries but significantly simpler to implement and maintain
- Appropriate when dependency flows are unidirectional and complexity needs to be minimized

## Key Points
1. **Graduated Boundaries**: Partial boundaries provide a middle ground between no separation and full architectural boundaries
2. **Future Options**: Implementing partial boundaries preserves the option to create full boundaries when justified by changing requirements
3. **Complexity Trade-offs**: Partial boundaries balance architectural benefits against implementation and maintenance complexity
