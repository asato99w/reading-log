# Chapter 26: The Main Component

## Chapter Overview
This chapter examines the role of the main component as the ultimate detail that creates and coordinates all other system components, serving as the initial entry point and dependency injector.

## Main Content

### Main as the Ultimate Detail
- The main component is the lowest-level module in the system, responsible for loading and starting everything else
- Main knows about all other components but no other component should know about main
- It serves as the initial configuration point where all dependencies are wired together
- Main is a plugin to the application, not a central organizing principle

### Dependency Injection and Main
- Main is responsible for creating concrete instances of interfaces defined by higher-level policies
- It resolves all dependency injection requirements before passing control to higher-level components
- Configuration files and environment variables are typically handled in the main component
- Main handles the transition from system startup to application execution

### Main in Different Architectural Styles
- In Clean Architecture, main creates use case objects and wires them to controllers and presenters
- In microservices, each service has its own main component handling service-specific initialization
- Web applications have main components that configure frameworks and routing
- The main component's responsibilities remain consistent across different architectural approaches

## Key Points
1. **System Bootstrap**: Main component handles all system initialization and dependency resolution before transferring control
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Main is responsible for creating concrete implementations and wiring the dependency graph
3. **Architectural Detail**: Despite its importance for system operation, main is an architectural detail that shouldn't influence system design
