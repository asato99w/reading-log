# Chapter 32: Frameworks Are Details

## Chapter Overview
This chapter provides guidance on maintaining architectural independence while leveraging framework benefits, avoiding framework lock-in that can compromise long-term system flexibility and maintainability.

## Main Content

### The Framework Dilemma
- Frameworks provide significant productivity benefits but can create architectural dependencies
- Framework authors solve their own problems, which may not align perfectly with your architectural needs
- Framework evolution and breaking changes can force unwanted changes throughout your system
- The key is using frameworks without becoming architecturally dependent on them

### Asymmetric Marriage with Frameworks
- You commit to the framework, but the framework doesn't commit to you
- Framework updates may break your code or require significant migration effort
- Framework abandonment leaves you with legacy code that's difficult to maintain
- Business rules should be protected from framework changes through architectural boundaries

### Framework Integration Strategies
- Keep frameworks at arm's length by wrapping them in interfaces you control
- Don't inherit from framework classes in your business rule components
- Use frameworks in your outermost layers (web controllers, database access) but not in business rules
- Dependency injection can help isolate framework dependencies to specific modules

## Key Points
1. **Framework Boundaries**: Frameworks should be isolated in outer architectural layers to protect business rules
2. **Independence Maintenance**: Architectural decisions should not be driven by framework capabilities or limitations
3. **Strategic Usage**: Leverage framework benefits while maintaining the ability to change or replace frameworks when necessary
