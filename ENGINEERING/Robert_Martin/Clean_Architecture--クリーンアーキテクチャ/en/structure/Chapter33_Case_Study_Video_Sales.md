# Chapter 33: Case Study: Video Sales

## Chapter Overview
This chapter provides a comprehensive case study demonstrating Clean Architecture application in a realistic business scenario with evolving requirements, showing practical implementation decisions and trade-offs.

## Main Content

### The Video Sales System Requirements
- The system sells videos to customers through multiple channels (web, mobile)
- Features include user management, video catalog, purchasing, and viewing capabilities
- Requirements evolve to include subscription services, content recommendations, and administrative functions
- The architecture must support both current needs and anticipated future changes

### Architectural Decision Analysis
- Use cases are organized around business capabilities: purchase videos, manage subscriptions, view content
- Entities include User, Video, Purchase, and Subscription with their associated business rules
- Interface adapters handle web requests, database access, and external service integration
- The architecture supports testing by isolating business rules from implementation details

### Evolution and Change Management
- New requirements (recommendations, analytics) are accommodated through architectural extension
- Database changes don't affect business rule implementations due to proper abstraction
- New user interfaces (mobile apps, admin panels) reuse existing business logic
- The clean architecture enables incremental development and deployment of new features

## Key Points
1. **Practical Application**: Real-world case study demonstrates how Clean Architecture principles translate to actual implementation decisions
2. **Evolutionary Design**: The architecture accommodates changing requirements through extension rather than modification
3. **Business Focus**: Architectural organization reflects business capabilities and use cases rather than technical implementation details
