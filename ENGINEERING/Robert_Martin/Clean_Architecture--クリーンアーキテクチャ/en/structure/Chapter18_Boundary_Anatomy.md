# Chapter 18: Boundary Anatomy

## Chapter Overview
This chapter explores the mechanical aspects of boundary crossing and how proper interface design maintains architectural integrity while enabling system component communication.

## Main Content

### Boundary Crossing Mechanisms
- Boundaries are crossed through function calls, either direct or polymorphic
- Runtime dependencies can cross boundaries in either direction, but source dependencies must be unidirectional
- Polymorphic interfaces enable dependency inversion at boundary crossings
- Data transformation may be necessary when crossing boundaries to maintain architectural isolation

### Monoliths and Deployment Components
- Even in monolithic deployments, architectural boundaries provide important structural benefits
- Source-level boundaries enable independent development and testing of components
- Compile-time boundaries can prevent inappropriate dependencies between architectural layers
- Boundaries in monoliths prepare systems for potential future distributed deployment

### Local Processes and Services
- Process boundaries provide stronger isolation but introduce communication complexity
- Local inter-process communication is faster but still involves marshaling and system calls
- Service boundaries over networks introduce latency, reliability, and security concerns
- The communication mechanism should match the required level of isolation and independence

## Key Points
1. **Multiple Boundary Types**: Different boundary implementations provide varying levels of isolation and communication overhead
2. **Dependency Direction**: Source code dependencies must flow in one direction across boundaries, regardless of runtime flow
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Proper boundary design enables systems to scale from monoliths to distributed systems
