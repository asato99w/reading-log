# Chapter 22: The Clean Architecture

## Chapter Overview
This chapter presents the complete Clean Architecture model with its concentric layers and dependency rules, providing a practical implementation framework for building maintainable systems.

## Main Content

### The Concentric Layer Model
- Clean Architecture consists of concentric circles with dependencies pointing inward toward business rules
- **Outer layers**: Frameworks, drivers, databases, user interfaces - volatile implementation details
- **Inner layers**: Use cases, entities - stable business rules and policies
- The dependency rule states that source code dependencies can only point inward toward higher-level policies

### The Four Main Layers
- **Entities**: Enterprise-wide business rules and critical business data
- **Use Cases**: Application-specific business rules that orchestrate entities
- **Interface Adapters**: Controllers, presenters, gateways that convert data between use cases and external systems
- **Frameworks and Drivers**: External tools like databases, web frameworks, and device drivers

### Crossing Boundaries with Clean Interfaces
- Data crossing boundaries should be simple data structures or function arguments
- No inner layer should know anything about outer layers or their data formats
- Dependency inversion enables inner layers to call outer layers through interfaces
- The architecture supports testing by allowing business rules to be tested independently of external systems

## Key Points
1. **Dependency Direction**: All dependencies point inward toward business rules, protecting the most important code from external changes
2. **Layer Isolation**: Each layer has a specific responsibility and communicates with adjacent layers through clean interfaces
3. **Testable Design**: The architecture enables comprehensive testing of business rules without external dependencies
