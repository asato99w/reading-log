# Chapter 12: Components

## Chapter Overview
This chapter defines components as units of deployment and development, establishing the granular building blocks for architectural organization and system modularization.

## Main Content

### Defining Components as Architectural Units
- Components are the smallest entities that can be deployed as part of a system
- In compiled languages, components are aggregations of binary files (jar files, DLLs, shared libraries)
- In interpreted languages, components are aggregations of source files
- Components serve as the atom of architectural composition and the unit of deployment granularity

### Historical Evolution of Component Systems
- Early computing required manual linking of separately compiled modules into executable programs
- The rise of relocatable binaries and dynamic linking enabled flexible component composition
- Package management systems automated the resolution of component dependencies
- Modern container technologies extend component concepts to include runtime environments and dependencies

### Component Characteristics and Properties
- Well-designed components have clear interfaces and hide internal implementation details
- Components should be independently developable by separate teams or individuals
- Component boundaries represent significant architectural decisions about system decomposition
- Components can be composed into larger systems through well-defined connection mechanisms

## Key Points
1. **Deployment Granularity**: Components represent the smallest deployable units and serve as the fundamental building blocks of system architecture
2. **Independent Development**: Components enable parallel development by providing clear boundaries between development responsibilities
3. **Architectural Atoms**: Components are the basic units of architectural composition, making system structure explicit and manageable
