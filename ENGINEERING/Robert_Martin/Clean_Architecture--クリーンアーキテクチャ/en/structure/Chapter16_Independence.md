# Chapter 16: Independence

## Chapter Overview
This chapter discusses architectural independence through decoupling modes: source, binary, and execution, enabling flexible deployment topologies and system evolution strategies.

## Main Content

### Use Cases as the Primary Organizing Principle
- The most important architectural consideration is supporting the use cases of the system
- Architecture should make the system's intent clear and support the behavioral requirements
- Use cases drive the fundamental decomposition of the system into architectural components
- Good architecture ensures that use cases are visible and central to the system's structure

### Decoupling Modes and Their Trade-offs
- **Source Level**: Modules can be independently developed and deployed as source code
- **Binary Level**: Components can be independently deployed as binary artifacts
- **Service Level**: Components run in separate processes and communicate over network interfaces
- Each level involves different trade-offs between development convenience and operational complexity

### Operational Independence Considerations
- Systems need different operational modes at different times in their lifecycle
- Architecture should accommodate both monolithic and distributed deployment without fundamental changes
- Service boundaries should be chosen carefully as they are expensive to change later
- The ability to push deployment decisions into the future preserves valuable options

## Key Points
1. **Use Case Centricity**: Architecture should be organized primarily around use cases rather than technical concerns
2. **Decoupling Flexibility**: Different decoupling modes provide options for deployment and scaling without architectural changes
3. **Deployment Agnostic**: Good architecture supports various deployment topologies from monolithic to distributed systems
