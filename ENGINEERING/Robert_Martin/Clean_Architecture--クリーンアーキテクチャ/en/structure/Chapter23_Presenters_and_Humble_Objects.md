# Chapter 23: Presenters and Humble Objects

## Chapter Overview
This chapter explains the Humble Object pattern for separating testable logic from hard-to-test presentation concerns, enabling comprehensive testing strategies across architectural boundaries.

## Main Content

### The Humble Object Pattern
- Split behaviors into two modules: one humble (hard to test) and one testable (easy to test)
- The humble module contains minimal logic and is primarily concerned with interfacing to hard-to-test environments
- The testable module contains all the complex logic and can be tested without the difficult environment
- This pattern enables testing of complex behaviors even when they involve hard-to-test systems

### Presenters as Humble Objects
- Presenters format data for display but contain no business logic or complex formatting rules
- View models contain pre-formatted, display-ready data that requires no further processing
- Business rules and formatting logic reside in testable interactors, not in presentation components
- The presenter simply takes pre-formatted data and places it in the appropriate view elements

### Database Gateways and Humble Objects
- Database gateways are humble objects that contain minimal SQL and data access logic
- Complex business rules and data transformation occur in testable interactors
- Database-specific code is isolated in gateways, making business logic database-independent
- This separation enables testing of business logic without database dependencies

## Key Points
1. **Testing Separation**: Humble Object pattern enables testing of complex logic by separating it from hard-to-test environments
2. **Minimal Logic in Boundaries**: Components that cross architectural boundaries should contain minimal logic to maintain testability
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Proper use of Humble Objects enables near-complete test coverage of business logic
