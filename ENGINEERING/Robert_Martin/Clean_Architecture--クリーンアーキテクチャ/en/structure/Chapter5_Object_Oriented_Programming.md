# Chapter 5: Object-Oriented Programming

## Chapter Overview
This chapter demystifies object-oriented programming as primarily about polymorphism enabling dependency inversion, which becomes crucial for architectural boundary management and system flexibility.

## Main Content

### The True Nature of Object-Oriented Programming
- Object-oriented programming is fundamentally about polymorphism, not encapsulation or inheritance
- Encapsulation existed before OOP (through C structures and function pointers)
- Inheritance was available through manual techniques in procedural languages
- Polymorphism through virtual functions is OOP's unique and revolutionary contribution

### Polymorphism and Dependency Inversion
- Polymorphism enables the inversion of source code dependencies while maintaining runtime dependencies
- High-level modules can avoid depending on low-level modules through polymorphic interfaces
- The ability to create plugin architectures where main business logic doesn't depend on details
- Dynamic dispatch through virtual function tables makes dependency inversion practical and safe

### Architectural Benefits of OOP
- Object-oriented design enables the creation of stable architectural boundaries
- Business rules can remain independent of user interfaces, databases, and frameworks
- System components can be deployed independently when properly designed with OOP principles
- The Open-Closed Principle becomes achievable through polymorphic extension points

## Key Points
1. **Polymorphism as Core**: Object-oriented programming's essential contribution is safe, convenient polymorphism through virtual functions
2. **Dependency Inversion**: Polymorphism enables architectural patterns where high-level policies don't depend on low-level implementation details
3. **Architectural Boundaries**: OOP provides the mechanisms necessary to create flexible, maintainable system architectures with clear component separation
