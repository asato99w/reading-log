# CLAUDE.md - Design Patterns Reading Log Project

## Project Overview
This is a reading log project for "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides). Published in 1994, this seminal work introduced 23 fundamental design patterns that became essential knowledge for object-oriented software development and established a common vocabulary for discussing recurring design solutions.

## Book Structure
The book is organized into two main parts with 23 design patterns across three categories:

### Part I: Introduction to Design Patterns
- Chapter 1: Introduction
- Chapter 2: A Case Study: Designing a Document Editor

### Part II: Design Pattern Catalog
#### Creational Patterns (5 patterns)
- Abstract Factory: Provide interface for creating families of related objects
- Builder: Separate construction of complex object from its representation  
- Factory Method: Create objects without specifying exact classes
- Prototype: Create objects by cloning existing instances
- Singleton: Ensure class has only one instance with global access

#### Structural Patterns (7 patterns)
- Adapter: Allow incompatible interfaces to work together
- Bridge: Separate abstraction from implementation
- Composite: Compose objects into tree structures for part-whole hierarchies
- Decorator: Add behavior to objects dynamically without altering structure
- Facade: Provide unified interface to subsystem
- Flyweight: Use sharing to support large numbers of objects efficiently
- Proxy: Provide surrogate or placeholder for another object

#### Behavioral Patterns (11 patterns)
- Chain of Responsibility: Pass requests along chain of handlers
- Command: Encapsulate requests as objects
- Interpreter: Define grammar and interpreter for language
- Iterator: Provide way to access elements sequentially without exposing structure
- Mediator: Define how set of objects interact with loose coupling
- Memento: Capture and restore object's internal state
- Observer: Define one-to-many dependency between objects
- State: Allow object to alter behavior when internal state changes
- Strategy: Define family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
- Template Method: Define skeleton of algorithm, letting subclasses override steps
- Visitor: Define new operation without changing classes it operates on

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understanding fundamental design patterns and their applications
- Mastering object-oriented design principles through pattern implementation
- Learning to identify recurring design problems and apply appropriate solutions
- Building vocabulary for communicating complex design concepts
- Developing skills in creating flexible, reusable, and maintainable software

## Implementation Notes
Follow the established repository structure with bilingual content organization. Focus on the revolutionary impact of design patterns on object-oriented programming, emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical application. Each pattern should be analyzed for its structure, participants, collaborations, consequences, and modern relevance in contemporary software development including microservices, frameworks, and cloud-native applications.
