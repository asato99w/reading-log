# Chapter 3: Abstract Factory (Creational)

## Chapter Overview
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Main Content

### Intent and Structure
- Create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes
- Ensure that products from the same family are used together
- Support multiple product lines through parallel class hierarchies
- Enable system independence from product creation, composition, and representation

### Pattern Participants
- **AbstractFactory**: Interface for creating abstract product objects
- **ConcreteFactory**: Implements operations to create concrete product objects  
- **AbstractProduct**: Interface for type of product object
- **ConcreteProduct**: Product object created by corresponding concrete factory
- **Client**: Uses only interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct

### Implementation Considerations
- Factories are often implemented as singletons to ensure single instance per product family
- Creating products typically requires Factory Method pattern for each product type
- Product families can be extended by adding new ConcreteFactory classes
- Switching between product families requires changing only the concrete factory instance

## Key Points
- **Family Consistency**: Abstract Factory ensures that products used together come from the same family, maintaining design consistency
- **Platform Independence**: Enables creation of platform-specific objects while keeping client code platform-independent
- **Easy Family Switching**: Changing product families requires only changing the concrete factory, not client code
