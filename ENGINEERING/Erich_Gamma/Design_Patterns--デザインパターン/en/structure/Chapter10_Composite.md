# Chapter 10: Composite (Structural)

## Chapter Overview
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## Main Content

### Intent and Structure
- Represent part-whole hierarchies where clients need uniform treatment of individual and composite objects
- Enable recursive composition where composite objects can contain other composites and leaves
- Simplify client code by eliminating need to distinguish between individual objects and compositions
- Support tree-like structures where operations can be applied uniformly across hierarchy levels

### Pattern Participants
- **Component**: Common interface for objects in composition, declaring operations for both leaf and composite objects
- **Leaf**: Represents leaf objects with no children, defines behavior for primitive objects in composition
- **Composite**: Defines behavior for components having children, stores child components and implements child-related operations
- **Client**: Manipulates objects in composition through Component interface

### Implementation Considerations
- Component interface should include child management operations or separate them into composite-specific interface
- Child ordering may be important for some applications, affecting how composite manages children
- Caching composite operation results can improve performance for expensive computations
- Parent references in components enable upward navigation but complicate object sharing

### Design Trade-offs
- Safety vs. transparency trade-off in component interface design affects type safety and uniformity
- Memory overhead for parent references must be balanced against navigation convenience
- Child management responsibility can be in Component or Composite with different implications

## Key Points
- **Uniform Treatment**: Composite enables clients to treat individual objects and object compositions uniformly through common interface
- **Recursive Structure**: Pattern naturally supports recursive compositions where composites can contain other composites, creating tree structures
- **Simplified Client Code**: Clients don't need complex conditional logic to handle different object types, reducing code complexity and improving maintainability
