# Chapter 4: Builder (Creational)

## Chapter Overview
Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

## Main Content

### Intent and Structure
- Separate complex object construction from its representation
- Enable same construction process to create different representations
- Provide fine control over construction process through step-by-step approach
- Hide internal representation and construction details from client code

### Pattern Participants
- **Builder**: Abstract interface for creating parts of Product object
- **ConcreteBuilder**: Constructs and assembles parts by implementing Builder interface
- **Director**: Constructs object using Builder interface, controls construction sequence
- **Product**: Complex object under construction, may have different internal structures

### Implementation Considerations
- Director controls construction sequence but Builder handles actual object creation
- Different ConcreteBuilder implementations can create products with different representations
- Products don't need common interface since they may be quite different
- Builder can provide interface for retrieving constructed product

## Key Points
- **Construction Control**: Builder provides fine control over construction process, enabling step-by-step object creation
- **Representation Variation**: Same construction process can create products with different internal representations
- **Complex Object Assembly**: Particularly useful for objects requiring many construction steps or complex initialization
