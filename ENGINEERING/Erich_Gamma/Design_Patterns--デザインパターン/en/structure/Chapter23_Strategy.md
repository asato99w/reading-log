# Chapter 23: Strategy (Behavioral)

## Chapter Overview
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime, allowing algorithm selection independent of client code.

## Main Content

### Intent and Structure
- Define family of algorithms and make them interchangeable within that family
- Encapsulate algorithms and make them independent of clients that use them
- Eliminate conditional statements for algorithm selection by using polymorphism
- Enable runtime algorithm selection based on context or configuration

### Pattern Participants
- **Strategy**: Common interface for all concrete strategies, defining algorithm signature
- **ConcreteStrategy**: Implements specific algorithm using Strategy interface
- **Context**: Maintains reference to Strategy object and delegates algorithm execution to strategy
- **Client**: Creates specific ConcreteStrategy object and passes it to Context

### Implementation Considerations
- Strategy interface design affects performance and flexibility of algorithm implementations
- Context may pass data to strategy or strategy may access context data through parameters
- Number of ConcreteStrategy classes increases system complexity but improves flexibility
- Strategy creation and selection mechanisms may require factory patterns or configuration systems

## Key Points
- **Algorithm Encapsulation**: Strategy encapsulates algorithms in separate classes, making them reusable and interchangeable while hiding implementation details
- **Runtime Flexibility**: Algorithms can be selected and changed at runtime based on conditions, configuration, or user preferences
- **Open-Closed Principle**: New strategies can be added without modifying existing Context or other strategy implementations, supporting system extension
