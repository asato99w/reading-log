# Chapter 2: A Case Study - Designing a Document Editor

## Chapter Overview
Demonstrates practical application of multiple design patterns through comprehensive document editor example, showing how patterns work together in realistic applications.

## Main Content

### Document Structure Design
- Document represented as tree structure of graphical objects using Composite pattern
- Enables uniform treatment of characters, lines, paragraphs, and pages
- Recursive structure allows complex documents with nested elements
- Client code can treat individual glyphs and composite structures identically

### Formatting Algorithms
- Different formatting strategies implemented using Strategy pattern
- Enables runtime selection of formatting algorithms based on document type or user preference
- Strategies include simple composition, TeX-style formatting, and table formatting
- Context maintains reference to current strategy and delegates formatting operations

### User Interface Decoration
- Window embellishments added using Decorator pattern
- Enables dynamic addition of scroll bars, borders, and drop shadows
- Decorators can be combined in various orders to achieve different visual effects
- Maintains consistent interface while extending functionality transparently

### Supporting Multiple Look-and-Feel Standards
- Abstract Factory pattern used to create families of user interface objects
- Enables support for different windowing systems (Motif, Presentation Manager, etc.)
- Factory families ensure consistent look-and-feel across all interface elements
- Application code remains independent of specific user interface toolkit

## Key Points
- **Pattern Integration**: Multiple patterns work together synergistically to address different aspects of the same complex design problem
- **Realistic Complexity**: Document editor demonstrates patterns in context of actual software requirements rather than toy examples
- **Design Evolution**: Shows how patterns enable design to evolve and adapt to changing requirements while maintaining architectural integrity
