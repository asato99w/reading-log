## Chapter Overview
Integrates strategic design patterns into comprehensive approach for managing complexity in enterprise-scale software development.

## Main Content

### Strategic Design Integration
- Bounded contexts, core domain identification, and large-scale structure work together as coherent strategic approach
- Context mapping guides integration decisions while domain distillation focuses development effort
- Large-scale structure provides organizational framework while maintaining domain model integrity
- Strategic patterns must be applied consistently across organization to achieve maximum benefit

### Assessment and Planning Process
- Regular assessment of context boundaries and their relationships enables adaptive strategic planning
- Domain distillation requires ongoing evaluation as business priorities and competitive landscape evolve
- Large-scale structure should be periodically reviewed and refined based on actual system evolution
- Strategic design decisions should be documented and communicated clearly across organization

### Organizational Transformation
- DDD strategic practices require changes to how organizations structure teams and make technology decisions
- Conway's Law suggests system architecture will reflect organizational communication patterns
- Successful DDD adoption requires alignment between business strategy, team structure, and technical architecture
- Change management and education are essential for successful strategic design implementation

## Key Points
- **Integrated Approach**: Strategic design patterns achieve maximum value when applied together as coherent system rather than isolated techniques
- **Adaptive Strategy**: Strategic design requires ongoing reassessment and adjustment as business and technical contexts evolve
- **Organizational Alignment**: Successful strategic design requires changes to organizational structure and decision-making processes, not just technical practices
