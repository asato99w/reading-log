# Chapter 1: Crunching Knowledge

## Chapter Overview
Introduces the collaborative process of knowledge crunching between domain experts and developers to discover and refine understanding of business domains.

## Main Content

### Collaborative Discovery Process
- Domain knowledge emerges through ongoing collaboration rather than upfront requirements gathering
- Developers and domain experts must work together iteratively to uncover deep domain insights
- Knowledge crunching involves questioning assumptions and exploring edge cases that reveal domain complexity
- The process requires patience and willingness to refactor understanding as new insights emerge

### Domain Expert Engagement
- Domain experts possess crucial business knowledge but may not recognize what's important for modeling
- Effective collaboration requires creating safe spaces for experts to share knowledge and uncertainty
- Questions should focus on business rules, workflows, and exceptions rather than technical implementation
- Building trust enables experts to reveal complex business nuances often hidden in informal processes

### Model Evolution Through Learning
- Initial models are necessarily incomplete and must evolve as understanding deepens
- Breakthrough insights often come from exploring contradictions and edge cases in current understanding
- Successful knowledge crunching produces models that surprise even domain experts with new clarity
- The goal is not perfect initial design but sustainable evolution toward better domain representation

## Key Points
- **Iterative Understanding**: Domain knowledge develops through cycles of modeling, testing, and refinement rather than comprehensive upfront analysis
- **Expert Partnership**: Domain experts are essential partners in model development, requiring ongoing collaboration and mutual learning throughout project lifecycle
- **Knowledge Emergence**: The most valuable domain insights often emerge unexpectedly through exploration of business edge cases and apparent contradictions
