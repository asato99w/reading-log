# Chapter 4: Isolating the Domain

## Chapter Overview
Introduces layered architecture as means to separate domain logic from technical concerns and maintain domain model purity.

## Main Content

### Layered Architecture Pattern
- Domain layer contains business logic and rules, isolated from technical infrastructure
- Application layer coordinates domain objects but contains no business logic itself
- Infrastructure layer handles persistence, messaging, and external system integration
- User interface layer presents information and captures user input without business logic

### Domain Layer Protection
- Domain objects must not depend on infrastructure concerns like databases or web frameworks
- Business rules should be expressed in domain layer using ubiquitous language
- Domain layer should be testable without external dependencies or technical infrastructure
- Dependency inversion ensures domain layer remains stable while technical layers can evolve

### Separation Benefits and Challenges
- Clean separation enables independent evolution of business logic and technical infrastructure
- Domain experts can understand isolated domain layer without technical complexity
- Testing becomes easier when domain logic doesn't require external system setup
- Maintaining layer discipline requires ongoing architectural vigilance and team discipline

## Key Points
- **Layer Isolation**: Domain layer must be protected from infrastructure dependencies to maintain business logic clarity and enable independent testing
- **Business Logic Concentration**: All business rules and domain knowledge should reside in the domain layer, not scattered across technical layers
- **Technical Flexibility**: Proper layering enables technology changes without affecting core business logic, supporting long-term system evolution
