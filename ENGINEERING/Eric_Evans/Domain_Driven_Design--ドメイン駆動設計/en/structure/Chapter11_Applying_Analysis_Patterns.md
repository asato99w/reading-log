# Chapter 11: Applying Analysis Patterns

## Chapter Overview
Demonstrates how to adapt generic analysis patterns to specific domain contexts while maintaining domain-specific expressiveness.

## Main Content

### Analysis Pattern Integration
- Generic patterns provide starting points but must be adapted to specific domain vocabulary
- Pattern application should enhance rather than replace domain-specific modeling
- Successful pattern use maintains ubiquitous language rather than imposing generic terminology
- Patterns work best when they align naturally with existing domain concepts and expert language

### Domain-Specific Adaptation
- Generic pattern elements must be renamed and refined to match domain terminology
- Pattern relationships may need adjustment to reflect actual business relationships
- Additional domain-specific constraints and behaviors should be added to generic pattern foundation
- Pattern implementation should feel natural to domain experts, not like imposed technical abstraction

### Pattern Selection Criteria
- Choose patterns that illuminate rather than obscure important domain concepts
- Patterns should simplify complex domain relationships rather than add unnecessary abstraction
- Best patterns make domain expert knowledge more explicit and discussable
- Avoid patterns that require significant departure from natural domain language

## Key Points
- **Adaptation Over Adoption**: Analysis patterns require careful adaptation to domain context rather than direct implementation
- **Domain Primacy**: Domain language and concepts should drive pattern application, not the reverse
- **Expert Alignment**: Successful pattern use enhances domain expert understanding rather than creating technical abstractions they cannot relate to
