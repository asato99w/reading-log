# CLAUDE.md - Domain-Driven Design Reading Log Project

## Project Overview
This is a reading log project for "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" by Eric Evans. Published in 2003, this seminal work established a comprehensive approach to managing complexity in software systems through deep domain modeling and strategic design patterns that have become fundamental to modern software architecture.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understanding how to create effective domain models through collaboration
- Mastering tactical patterns: Entity, Value Object, Aggregate, Repository, Service
- Learning strategic design for managing complexity in large systems
- Building ubiquitous language to bridge technical and business domains

## Implementation Notes
Follow the established repository structure with bilingual content organization. Focus on DDD's revolutionary approach to software complexity, emphasizing both tactical patterns and strategic design that have influenced modern architectural approaches including microservices and event-driven systems.
