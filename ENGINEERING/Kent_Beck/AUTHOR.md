# Kent Beck

## Biography
Kent Beck (born 1961) is an American software engineer and the creator of Extreme Programming (XP) and Test-Driven Development (TDD). He is widely recognized as one of the original signatories of the Agile Manifesto and a pioneer in software development methodologies that emphasize simplicity, communication, and feedback.

## Academic Background
- **Education**: B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from University of Oregon
- **Early Career**: Worked at Apple Computer, where he paired with Ward Cunningham
- **Research Interests**: Software patterns, development methodologies, programmer productivity

## Major Contributions

### Extreme Programming (XP)
- Developed XP methodology in the late 1990s
- Emphasized practices like pair programming, continuous integration, and test-first development
- Published "Extreme Programming Explained" (1999), revolutionizing agile development

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Formalized TDD as a development practice
- Created the xUnit testing framework architecture
- Wrote "Test-Driven Development: By Example" (2002), establishing TDD as standard practice

### Software Patterns Movement
- Co-authored "Contributing to Eclipse" (2003)
- Contributed to the patterns community with Ward Cunningham
- Developed JUnit with Erich Gamma, the most influential testing framework

## Key Publications
- **Extreme Programming Explained** (1999, 2004 2nd edition)
- **Test-Driven Development: By Example** (2002)
- **Contributing to Eclipse** (2003, with Erich Gamma)
- **Implementation Patterns** (2007)
- **JUnit Pocket Guide** (2004)

## Professional Career
- **Tektronix**: Early career with Ward Cunningham
- **Apple Computer**: Worked on HyperCard
- **Facebook**: Coaching and development (2011-2018)
- **Gusto**: Chief Scientist (2019-present)
- **Three Rivers Institute**: Founder, focusing on software development excellence

## Awards and Recognition
- ACM Fellow (2020)
- Agile Alliance Gordon Pask Award (2003)
- Dr. Dobb's Excellence in Programming Award

## Philosophy and Approach

### Core Values
- **Simplicity**: Do the simplest thing that could possibly work
- **Communication**: Code should clearly communicate intent
- **Feedback**: Short cycles and rapid iteration
- **Courage**: Make necessary changes without fear
- **Respect**: For teammates and the code itself

### Development Principles
- "Make it work, make it right, make it fast"
- Incremental design and evolutionary architecture
- Embrace change rather than resist it
- Software development as a human activity

## Influence on Industry

### Agile Movement
- Original signatory of the Agile Manifesto (2001)
- XP became one of the most influential agile methodologies
- Influenced Scrum, Kanban, and other agile practices

### Testing Culture
- JUnit spawned the xUnit family of frameworks
- TDD became standard practice in many organizations
- Changed how developers think about quality and design

### Development Practices
- Pair programming adoption in mainstream development
- Continuous integration as standard practice
- Refactoring as a disciplined practice

## Legacy
Kent Beck's contributions fundamentally changed how software is developed. His emphasis on human factors in programming, the importance of testing, and the value of simplicity have influenced generations of developers. XP and TDD remain cornerstones of modern software development, and his ideas continue to evolve and adapt to new contexts.

## Current Work
Continues to write, speak, and consult on software development. Active on social media, sharing insights on programming, team dynamics, and the human side of software development. His recent work focuses on "Tidy First?" - exploring the economics and psychology of software design decisions.

## Notable Quotes
- "I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits."
- "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."
- "Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment."
