# Chapter 14: Designing

## Chapter Overview
Beck explains XP's approach to software design, emphasizing incremental design evolution over big upfront design, supported by refactoring and testing.

## Main Content
- **Incremental Design Philosophy**
  - Design emerges through small, frequent improvements rather than big upfront planning
  - Current design should be best possible for current requirements
  - Design complexity should match current problem complexity
  - Future design needs addressed when they become present needs

- **Design Quality Principles**
  - Simple design that expresses intention clearly
  - No duplication to avoid maintenance problems
  - Minimal elements to reduce complexity
  - Passes all tests to ensure correctness

- **Refactoring as Continuous Design**
  - Regular code improvement to maintain design quality
  - Small, safe steps that preserve functionality while improving structure
  - Refactoring enabled by comprehensive test coverage
  - Design evolution guided by actual usage patterns and requirements

## Key Points
- Incremental design reduces waste while maintaining flexibility for change
- Good design quality enables rather than slows development velocity
- Refactoring allows design to evolve safely in response to new understanding
