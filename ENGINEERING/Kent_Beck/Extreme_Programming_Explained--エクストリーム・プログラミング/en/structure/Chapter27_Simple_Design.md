# Chapter 27: Simple Design

## Chapter Overview
Beck explains XP's approach to simple design that focuses on current needs while maintaining flexibility for future change through refactoring.

## Main Content
- **Simple Design Criteria**
  - Runs all the tests to ensure correctness
  - Expresses every idea that needs to be expressed clearly
  - Says everything once and only once to eliminate duplication
  - Has no superfluous parts to minimize complexity

- **Design for Today vs. Tomorrow**
  - Focus design on current requirements rather than speculated future needs
  - Avoid premature optimization and over-engineering
  - Build flexibility through good design practices rather than unused features
  - Trust in refactoring to adapt design when future needs become present

- **Emergent Design Through Refactoring**
  - Design emerges through small improvements rather than big upfront planning
  - Patterns and abstractions arise naturally from actual usage
  - Continuous improvement guided by actual needs and constraints
  - Design evolution supported by comprehensive testing

## Key Points
- Simple design minimizes complexity while maximizing flexibility for change
- Good design emerges through refactoring rather than upfront planning
- The four criteria provide practical guidance for design decisions
