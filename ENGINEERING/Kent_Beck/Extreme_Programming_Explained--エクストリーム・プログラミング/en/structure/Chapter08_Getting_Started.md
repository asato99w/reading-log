# Chapter 8: Getting Started

## Chapter Overview
Beck provides practical guidance for teams beginning their XP journey, emphasizing gradual adoption and building on early successes rather than attempting comprehensive transformation.

## Main Content
- **Starting Small and Building Momentum**
  - Begin with one or two practices rather than attempting full XP adoption
  - Choose practices that provide quick wins and visible benefits
  - Build confidence and skills gradually before adding more practices
  - Success with initial practices creates momentum for further adoption

- **Choosing Initial Practices**
  - Select practices that address team's most pressing problems
  - Consider team's current capabilities and organizational constraints
  - Start with practices that have clear, measurable benefits
  - Avoid practices that require significant organizational change initially

- **Managing Resistance and Building Support**
  - Expect resistance to change and plan strategies to address it
  - Demonstrate value through results rather than just explanation
  - Involve skeptics in pilot projects to build understanding
  - Celebrate early successes to build momentum and support

## Key Points
- Successful XP adoption requires gradual, incremental approach rather than revolutionary change
- Early wins are crucial for building confidence and momentum
- Resistance is natural and should be addressed through demonstration rather than argument
