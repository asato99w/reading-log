# Chapter 12: Planning

## Chapter Overview
Beck describes XP's approach to planning, emphasizing adaptive planning over predictive planning. The planning game balances business and technical concerns while accommodating uncertainty and change.

## Main Content
- **Planning Game Mechanics**
  - Business people decide scope, priority, composition of releases, and dates of releases
  - Technical people decide estimates, consequences of scope changes, process, and detailed scheduling
  - Collaboration between business and technical perspectives to make informed decisions
  - Regular planning cycles that adapt to new information and changing circumstances

- **Story-Based Planning**
  - User stories capture requirements in conversational, testable format
  - Stories written by customers in their own words to ensure understanding
  - Estimation based on relative complexity rather than absolute time predictions
  - Story splitting and combining to fit into iterations and releases

- **Adaptive vs. Predictive Planning**
  - Plans are updated frequently based on actual progress and learning
  - Planning focuses on next iteration in detail, with broader strokes for longer horizons
  - Velocity tracking provides empirical basis for future planning
  - Acceptance of uncertainty and variability rather than pretense of precision

- **Release and Iteration Planning**
  - Release planning sets overall direction and major milestones
  - Iteration planning commits to specific deliverables for short time periods
  - Daily planning adjusts to unexpected obstacles and opportunities
  - Multiple planning horizons enable both strategic direction and tactical flexibility

## Key Points
- Planning in XP is a collaborative activity that balances business needs with technical realities
- Plans are tools for coordination and communication rather than contracts or predictions
- Frequent re-planning based on actual experience prevents projects from pursuing obsolete goals
