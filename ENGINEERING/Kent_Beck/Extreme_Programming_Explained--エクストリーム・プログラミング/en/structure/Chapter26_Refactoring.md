## Main Content
- **Refactoring Definition and Process**
  - Changing code structure without changing external behavior
  - Small, safe steps that preserve functionality throughout
  - Comprehensive tests provide safety net for refactoring activities
  - Regular practice rather than periodic major restructuring

- **When and Why to Refactor**
  - Before adding new functionality to improve code receptivity
  - When code becomes difficult to understand or modify
  - To eliminate duplication and improve design clarity
  - As part of regular development rhythm rather than special project

- **Refactoring Techniques and Discipline**
  - Catalog of safe refactoring transformations
  - Tool support for automated refactoring where possible
  - Disciplined approach that maintains test success throughout
  - Team-wide refactoring culture and shared responsibility

## Key Points
- Refactoring enables sustainable development by preventing design decay
- Small, frequent refactoring is safer and more effective than periodic major restructuring
- Comprehensive testing is essential foundation that makes refactoring possible
