# Chapter 18: Offshore Development

## Chapter Overview
Beck discusses applying XP principles to distributed and offshore development scenarios, addressing communication challenges and maintaining team cohesion across geographic boundaries.

## Main Content
- **Communication Challenges in Distributed Teams**
  - Reduced bandwidth of communication across time zones and distance
  - Cultural differences affecting collaboration and understanding
  - Technology tools needed to support remote collaboration
  - Strategies for maintaining high-bandwidth communication

- **Adapting XP Practices for Distribution**
  - Pair programming using screen sharing and collaboration tools
  - Continuous integration becomes more critical for coordination
  - Daily stand-ups across time zones for team synchronization
  - Shared code ownership requiring additional coordination protocols

- **Building Trust and Team Cohesion**
  - Face-to-face meetings periodically to build relationships
  - Clear agreements on working hours and communication protocols
  - Shared commitment to project success despite geographic separation
  - Cultural sensitivity and understanding in team interactions

## Key Points
- Distributed development requires adaptation of practices while maintaining XP values
- Communication bandwidth decreases with distance but remains essential for success
- Technology and process changes can partially compensate for geographic separation
