# Chapter 22: Dealing with Failure

## Chapter Overview
Adding proper failure handling to the testing framework to catch and report test failures gracefully. Shows how to build robust error handling that provides useful diagnostic information when tests fail.

## Main Content
- **Exception Handling Implementation**
  - Catching exceptions during test execution to prevent framework crashes
  - Understanding how to handle test failures without stopping the test run
  - Implementing try-catch mechanisms around test method invocation
  - Converting exceptions into meaningful test failure information

- **Failure Reporting**
  - Recording detailed information about test failures
  - Understanding how to capture and preserve failure context
  - Implementing failure messages that help developers diagnose problems
  - Building failure reporting that supports debugging and problem resolution

- **Robust Test Execution**
  - Ensuring that test failures don't prevent other tests from running
  - Understanding how to maintain test isolation even when tests fail
  - Implementing graceful degradation when things go wrong
  - Building resilient test execution that handles unexpected situations

## Key Points
- Test frameworks must handle failures gracefully without crashing or stopping other tests
- Good failure reporting captures enough context to help developers understand and fix problems
- Robust exception handling ensures that failing tests don't interfere with subsequent test execution
