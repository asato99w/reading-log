# Chapter 1: Multi-Currency Money

## Chapter Overview
Introduction to TDD through the simplest possible example: making $5 Ã— 2 = $10 work. Demonstrates the fundamental Red-Green-Refactor cycle by writing a failing test first, making it pass with minimal code, and preparing for future improvements.

## Main Content
- **Writing the First Test**
  - Starting with a simple multiplication requirement
  - Creating the initial test case for Dollar multiplication
  - Dealing with compilation errors as the first step to green
  - Understanding what makes a good starting test

- **Fake Implementation Strategy**
  - Making the test pass by returning hardcoded value (10)
  - Explaining why "fake it" is a valid and valuable first step
  - Building confidence through achieving the first green bar
  - Setting up the foundation for generalization

- **Test List Management**
  - Creating and maintaining a TODO list of tests to write
  - Using the list to stay focused and track progress
  - Planning the next steps in the TDD process
  - Understanding the iterative nature of TDD development

## Key Points
- Start with the simplest test that teaches you something new about the requirements
- Use fake implementation to quickly reach green, then refactor to make it real
- Maintain a test list to keep track of what needs to be done and stay focused on one thing at a time
