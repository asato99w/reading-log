# Chapter 24: Test-Driven Development Patterns

## Chapter Overview
Introduction to the foundational patterns that form the basis of effective TDD practice. These patterns provide a vocabulary and systematic approach for discussing and implementing test-driven development techniques across different contexts and programming languages.

## Main Content
- **Isolated Test Pattern**
  - Ensuring tests do not depend on each other or external state
  - Creating fresh test environments for each test execution
  - Designing tests that can run in any order with consistent results
  - Understanding the importance of test independence for reliable feedback

- **Test List Pattern**
  - Maintaining a written list of tests that need to be implemented
  - Using the list to stay focused and avoid scope creep
  - Adding new test ideas as they occur during development
  - Crossing off completed tests to track progress and maintain motivation

- **Test First Pattern**
  - Writing tests before writing production code
  - Using tests to define the interface and expected behavior
  - Letting tests drive the design of the code being developed
  - Creating executable documentation through test specifications

## Key Points
- Patterns provide a shared vocabulary for discussing TDD practices and techniques within development teams
- Each pattern addresses specific challenges and problems commonly encountered in test-driven development
- Patterns work synergistically to create an effective development rhythm and sustainable practices
