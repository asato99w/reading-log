# Chapter 30: Refactoring

## Chapter Overview
Refactoring patterns specifically relevant to TDD practice. These patterns help developers improve code design systematically while maintaining the safety net of comprehensive tests.

## Main Content
- **Reconcile Differences Pattern**
  - Identifying and unifying similar code that has diverged over time
  - Understanding how to merge similar implementations safely
  - Using tests to ensure behavior preservation during unification
  - Creating common abstractions from similar concrete implementations

- **Isolate Change Pattern**
  - Making changes in isolated areas to minimize risk and impact
  - Understanding how to contain the effects of modifications
  - Using interfaces and abstractions to create change boundaries
  - Building flexibility points that enable future modifications

- **Extract Method Pattern**
  - Breaking down complex methods into smaller, focused methods
  - Understanding how method extraction improves testability and readability
  - Choosing appropriate method boundaries and naming
  - Using method extraction to reveal and eliminate duplication

## Key Points
- Refactoring patterns help systematically improve design while maintaining working code
- Good refactoring preserves all existing behavior while improving code structure and clarity
- TDD provides the safety net that makes aggressive refactoring possible and safe
