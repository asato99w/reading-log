# Chapter 18: First Steps to xUnit

## Chapter Overview
Beginning the development of a testing framework using TDD to test itself. Introduces the meta-programming challenge of building testing tools with test-driven development, starting with the simplest possible test execution mechanism.

## Main Content
- **Bootstrap Problem**
  - Addressing the challenge of testing a test framework without having a test framework
  - Starting with manual verification and print statements
  - Building toward automated self-testing capabilities
  - Understanding the recursive nature of the problem

- **WasRun Test Case**
  - Creating a simple test case that tracks whether it has been executed
  - Using a flag mechanism to record test execution
  - Implementing the most basic test runner functionality
  - Proving the concept with minimal viable implementation

- **Python Dynamic Features**
  - Leveraging Python's dynamic method invocation capabilities
  - Using string-based method names for test discovery
  - Simple class structures for test organization
  - Taking advantage of Python's reflective capabilities for framework development

## Key Points
- Testing frameworks can be built incrementally using TDD principles, even when testing themselves
- Start with manual verification, then automate as quickly as possible to enable rapid iteration
- The self-referential nature of testing a test framework demonstrates TDD's universal applicability
