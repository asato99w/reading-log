# Chapter 12: Addition, Finally

## Chapter Overview
Completing the addition implementation and making it work with Bank.reduce(). Demonstrates how TDD enables step-by-step implementation of complex functionality while maintaining working code throughout the process.

## Main Content
- **Sum.reduce() Implementation**
  - Implementing reduce() method in Sum class to evaluate addition
  - Understanding how composite expressions evaluate themselves
  - Making Sum work with Bank's evaluation framework
  - Completing the expression evaluation chain

- **Bank.reduce() Integration**
  - Ensuring Bank can handle Sum expressions properly
  - Understanding the visitor pattern application in expression evaluation
  - Making Bank.reduce() work uniformly with Money and Sum
  - Creating consistent evaluation interface

- **Expression Evaluation Completion**
  - Getting addition tests to pass completely
  - Understanding how object composition enables complex behavior
  - Seeing how small steps led to complete functionality
  - Preparing foundation for more complex operations

## Key Points
- Break complex operations into small, testable steps that build on each other incrementally
- Use polymorphism and interfaces to make different types of objects work uniformly in the same system
- Complete one operation fully before adding new operations to maintain system stability
