# Chapter 25: Red Bar Patterns

## Chapter Overview
Patterns for writing effective failing tests that guide development toward the right solutions. These patterns help developers choose appropriate tests that drive toward valuable implementations while maintaining development momentum.

## Main Content
- **One Step Test Pattern**
  - Choosing tests that teach you something new about the problem
  - Writing tests that represent meaningful progress toward the solution
  - Avoiding tests that are too large or too small to provide useful feedback
  - Understanding how test size affects learning and development flow

- **Starter Test Pattern** 
  - Beginning with the simplest test that could possibly fail
  - Building confidence through easy wins before tackling complex scenarios
  - Understanding how simple tests establish foundation for harder problems
  - Using obvious, straightforward tests to get development momentum

- **Explanation Test Pattern**
  - Writing tests that ask for clarification of uncertain requirements
  - Using tests to explore and document expected behavior
  - Converting questions about requirements into executable specifications
  - Understanding how tests can drive requirements discovery

## Key Points
- Choose tests that provide meaningful learning about the problem while being achievable in a short time
- Start with simple, obvious tests to build momentum before tackling more complex scenarios
- Use tests to explore and clarify uncertain requirements by turning questions into executable examples
