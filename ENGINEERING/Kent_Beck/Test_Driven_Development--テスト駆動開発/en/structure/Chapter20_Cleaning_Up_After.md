# Chapter 20: Cleaning Up After

## Chapter Overview
Adding tearDown() functionality to complement setUp(), providing complete test fixture lifecycle management. Shows how testing frameworks ensure clean test isolation and resource management.

## Main Content
- **tearDown() Method Implementation**
  - Adding automatic tearDown() method invocation after each test
  - Providing cleanup mechanism for test resources and state
  - Ensuring tests don't interfere with each other through proper cleanup
  - Completing the fixture lifecycle with setup and teardown

- **Test Isolation Enhancement**
  - Using tearDown() to reset state and clean up resources
  - Understanding how proper cleanup prevents test interdependencies
  - Ensuring each test runs in isolation from others
  - Managing external resources like files, database connections

- **Exception Handling Considerations**
  - Ensuring tearDown() runs even when tests fail or throw exceptions
  - Understanding the importance of cleanup in error scenarios
  - Building robust test execution that handles failures gracefully
  - Maintaining test isolation even when things go wrong

## Key Points
- tearDown() methods ensure proper cleanup and test isolation by resetting state after each test
- Cleanup must occur even when tests fail to prevent failures from affecting subsequent tests
- Complete fixture lifecycle (setUp/tearDown) enables tests to use external resources safely
