### Part II: The Refactoring Catalog (Chapters 6-12)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive techniques organized by transformation type

#### Chapter 6: A First Set of Refactorings
**Basic Transformations**: Fundamental refactoring techniques updated for JavaScript
- Extract Function (modernized from Extract Method)
- Inline Function (updated with arrow functions)
- Extract Variable (const/let considerations)
- Rename Variable (IDE integration)
- Introduce Parameter Object (destructuring support)
- Combine Functions into Class (ES6 classes)
- Combine Functions into Transform (functional approach)
- Split Phase (pipeline processing)

#### Chapter 7: Encapsulation
**Data Protection**: Modern approaches to data encapsulation
- Encapsulate Record (object literals and classes)
- Encapsulate Collection (array and Map/Set handling)
- Replace Primitive with Object (JavaScript type considerations)
- Replace Temp with Query (const/let scoping)
- Extract Class (module organization)
- Inline Class (module simplification)
- Hide Delegate (interface design)
- Remove Middle Man (direct access patterns)
- Substitute Algorithm (functional alternatives)

#### Chapter 8: Moving Features
**Code Organization**: Feature placement and organization
- Move Function (module and class organization)
- Move Field (property organization)
- Move Statements into Function (code consolidation)
- Move Statements to Callers (responsibility distribution)
- Replace Inline Code with Function Call (reusability)
- Slide Statements (code arrangement)
- Split Loop (functional programming influence)
- Replace Loop with Pipeline (array methods)

#### Chapter 9: Organizing Data
**Data Structure Management**: Modern data handling approaches
- Split Variable (const usage)
- Rename Field (property naming)
- Replace Derived Variable with Query (computed properties)
- Change Reference to Value (immutability considerations)
- Change Value to Reference (object identity)

#### Chapter 10: Simplifying Conditional Logic
**Decision Making**: Cleaner conditional structures
- Decompose Conditional (function extraction)
- Consolidate Conditional Expression (boolean logic)
- Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses (early returns)
- Replace Conditional with Polymorphism (class hierarchies)
- Introduce Special Case (null object pattern)
- Introduce Assertion (validation logic)

#### Chapter 11: Refactoring APIs
**Interface Design**: API evolution and improvement
- Separate Query from Modifier (side effect management)
- Parameterize Function (configuration patterns)
- Remove Flag Argument (explicit methods)
- Preserve Whole Object (parameter reduction)
- Replace Parameter with Query (dependency injection)
- Replace Query with Parameter (decoupling)
- Remove Setting Method (immutability)
- Replace Constructor with Factory Function (creation patterns)
- Replace Function with Command (complex operations)
- Replace Command with Function (simplification)

#### Chapter 12: Dealing with Inheritance
**Object-Oriented Design**: Class hierarchy management
- Pull Up Method (common behavior)
- Pull Up Field (shared data)
- Pull Up Constructor Body (initialization)
- Push Down Method (specialized behavior)
- Push Down Field (specific data)
- Replace Type Code with Subclasses (polymorphism)
- Remove Subclass (simplification)
- Extract Superclass (common abstraction)
- Collapse Hierarchy (unnecessary complexity)
- Replace Subclass with Delegate (composition over inheritance)
- Replace Superclass with Delegate (dependency inversion)

## Key Structural Differences from First Edition

### Language Evolution
- **JavaScript Focus**: All examples in modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Functional Elements**: Incorporation of functional programming concepts
- **Async Patterns**: Handling of asynchronous code and Promises
- **Module System**: ES6 modules and code organization

### Catalog Refinement
- **Streamlined Techniques**: Removed obsolete refactorings
- **New Patterns**: Added modern programming patterns
- **Better Organization**: Improved grouping and cross-references
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasis on commonly used techniques

### Modern Context
- **Web Development**: Frontend and backend JavaScript considerations
- **Framework Integration**: React, Vue, Angular patterns
- **Performance**: Modern JavaScript performance considerations
- **Tooling**: Integration with contemporary development tools

## Teaching Progression

### Learning Path 1: JavaScript Developers
1. Start with Chapter 1 example in familiar JavaScript
2. Understand principles in Chapter 2 with modern context
3. Learn to identify smells in Chapter 3
4. Master testing in Chapter 4 with current frameworks
5. Work through catalog Chapters 6-12 systematically

### Learning Path 2: Experienced Developers (First Edition Background)
1. Compare Chapter 1 with original Java example
2. Note principle updates in Chapter 2
3. Identify new smells in Chapter 3
