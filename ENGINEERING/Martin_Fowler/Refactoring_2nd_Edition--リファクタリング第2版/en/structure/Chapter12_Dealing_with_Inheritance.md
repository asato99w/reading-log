# Chapter 12: Dealing with Inheritance

## Chapter Overview
This chapter addresses object-oriented design in the ES6 class era, emphasizing composition over inheritance patterns and introducing modern techniques for replacing inheritance with delegation.

## Main Content
- **Classical Inheritance Operations**
  - Pull Up Method: Moving shared behavior to parent classes
  - Pull Up Field: Consolidating common properties in superclasses
  - Pull Up Constructor Body: Sharing initialization logic across class hierarchy
  - Push Down Method/Field: Specializing behavior in appropriate subclasses

- **Type Code and Subclass Management**
  - Replace Type Code with Subclasses: Creating polymorphic class hierarchies
  - Remove Subclass: Eliminating unnecessary inheritance complexity
  - Extract Superclass: Creating shared abstractions from similar classes
  - Collapse Hierarchy: Simplifying over-engineered inheritance structures

- **Modern Composition Patterns**
  - Replace Subclass with Delegate (New): Composition-first modern patterns
  - Replace Superclass with Delegate (New): Dependency inversion principle application
  - ES6 mixin patterns and multiple inheritance alternatives
  - Functional composition vs object-oriented inheritance trade-offs

## Key Points
- Modern JavaScript development favors composition over inheritance for flexibility and testing
- ES6 classes provide cleaner inheritance syntax but delegation patterns often prove more maintainable
- Component-based architectures (React, Vue) demonstrate successful composition patterns over inheritance
