# Chapter 1: Refactoring: A First Example

## Chapter Overview
This foundational chapter demonstrates the complete refactoring process through a modern JavaScript implementation of a video rental store program. Unlike the Java-based first edition, this example leverages contemporary JavaScript features and development practices to show how systematic code improvement works in today's development environment.

## Main Content

### Initial Problem: The Video Store Statement Function
- **Monolithic Function Structure**: Single function handling multiple responsibilities
  - Customer data management
  - Rental calculation logic
  - Pricing rule implementation
  - Output formatting for different media types
  - Business logic mixed with presentation concerns

- **Contemporary JavaScript Issues**: Modern code problems demonstrated
  - Complex conditional logic using switch statements
  - String concatenation instead of template literals
  - Mixed data types and responsibilities
  - Lack of proper separation of concerns
  - Difficulty in extending for new requirements (HTML output)

- **Real-World Relevance**: Problems common in modern web applications
  - API response formatting mixed with business logic
  - Frontend component logic handling multiple concerns
  - Database queries mixed with presentation logic
  - Difficulty in unit testing complex functions

### Modern JavaScript Refactoring Approach
- **ES6+ Feature Utilization**: Leveraging contemporary JavaScript
  - `const` and `let` for proper variable scoping
  - Arrow functions for concise function definitions
  - Template literals for string interpolation
  - Object destructuring for parameter handling
  - Modern array methods (map, filter, reduce) for data processing

- **Testing Integration**: Contemporary testing practices
  - Jest framework for unit testing
  - Test-first approach to ensure behavior preservation
  - Automated test execution during refactoring
  - Mock objects for external dependencies
  - Comprehensive test coverage as safety net

- **Development Tool Integration**: Modern development environment
  - IDE refactoring support and automated suggestions
  - ESLint integration for code quality checking
  - Prettier for consistent code formatting
  - Git workflow for tracking changes
  - Continuous integration pipeline integration

### Step-by-Step Transformation Process

#### Phase 1: Extract Function (Basic Decomposition)
- **Extract Amount Calculation**: Separating price calculation logic
  ```javascript
  function amountFor(aPerformance, play) {
    let result = 0;
    switch (play.type) {
      case "tragedy":
        result = 40000;
        if (aPerformance.audience > 30) {
          result += 1000 * (aPerformance.audience - 30);
        }
        break;
      // ... other cases
    }
    return result;
  }
  ```

- **Modern Function Definition**: Using contemporary JavaScript patterns
  - Clear function naming following JavaScript conventions
  - Parameter destructuring where appropriate
  - Return value clarity and type consistency
  - Single responsibility principle application

#### Phase 2: Variable Renaming and Clarity
- **Meaningful Variable Names**: Improving code readability
  - `aPerformance` â†’ `performance` (removing Hungarian notation)
  - `play` parameter clarification and documentation
  - Local variable naming for clarity and purpose
  - Consistent naming patterns throughout codebase

- **Scope Management**: Modern JavaScript scoping
  - `const` for immutable bindings
  - `let` for variables that need reassignment
  - Block scoping for loop variables
  - Avoiding variable hoisting issues

#### Phase 3: Replace Temp with Query
- **Eliminate Temporary Variables**: Converting to computed values
  ```javascript
  function playFor(aPerformance) {
    return plays[aPerformance.playID];
  }
  
  function amountFor(aPerformance) {
    return amountFor(aPerformance, playFor(aPerformance));
  }
  ```

- **Performance Considerations**: Modern JavaScript optimization
  - V8 engine optimization patterns
  - Function call overhead vs. readability trade-offs
  - Memory usage patterns in modern browsers
  - Caching strategies for expensive computations

#### Phase 4: Extract Volume Credits Calculation
- **Separate Concerns**: Isolating different business rules
  ```javascript
  function volumeCreditsFor(aPerformance) {
    let result = 0;
    result += Math.max(aPerformance.audience - 30, 0);
    if ("comedy" === playFor(aPerformance).type) {
      result += Math.floor(aPerformance.audience / 5);
    }
    return result;
  }
  ```

- **Business Logic Isolation**: Clear separation of calculation rules
  - Volume credit rules separate from amount calculation
  - Genre-specific logic encapsulated
  - Easy to modify or extend business rules
  - Clear testing boundaries for different rule types

#### Phase 5: Replace Loop with Pipeline
- **Functional Programming Integration**: Modern JavaScript patterns
  ```javascript
  function totalAmount(data) {
    return data.performances
      .reduce((total, p) => total + amountFor(p), 0);
  }
  
  function totalVolumeCredits(data) {
    return data.performances
      .reduce((total, p) => total + volumeCreditsFor(p), 0);
  }
  ```

- **Array Method Utilization**: Contemporary data processing
  - `reduce()` for aggregation operations
  - `map()` for data transformation
  - `filter()` for conditional processing
  - Method chaining for pipeline operations

#### Phase 6: Split Phase Transformation
- **Separate Data Gathering from Formatting**: Clear phase separation
  ```javascript
  function statement(invoice, plays) {
    return renderPlainText(createStatementData(invoice, plays));
  }
  
  function createStatementData(invoice, plays) {
    const statementData = {};
    statementData.customer = invoice.customer;
    statementData.performances = invoice.performances.map(enrichPerformance);
    statementData.totalAmount = totalAmount(statementData);
    statementData.totalVolumeCredits = totalVolumeCredits(statementData);
    return statementData;
  }
  ```

- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Modern architectural pattern
  - Input data validation and transformation
  - Business logic calculation phase
  - Output formatting phase separation
  - Easy to add new output formats (HTML, JSON, etc.)

### Final Architecture: Polymorphic Design
- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: Object-oriented patterns in JavaScript
  ```javascript
  class TragedyCalculator {
    compute(aPerformance) {
      let result = 40000;
      if (aPerformance.audience > 30) {
        result += 1000 * (aPerformance.audience - 30);
      }
      return result;
    }
  }
  
  class ComedyCalculator {
    compute(aPerformance) {
      let result = 30000;
      if (aPerformance.audience > 20) {
        result += 10000 + 500 * (aPerformance.audience - 20);
      }
      result += 300 * aPerformance.audience;
      return result;
    }
  }
  ```

- **Factory Pattern Implementation**: Modern JavaScript class usage
  - ES6 class syntax for clear object structure
  - Factory function for calculator selection
  - Strategy pattern for different calculation types
  - Easy extension for new performance types

### Modern Development Practices Integration
- **Continuous Testing**: Test-driven refactoring approach
  - Tests written before each refactoring step
  - Automated test execution with watch mode
  - Test coverage reporting and analysis
  - Regression testing throughout process

- **Version Control Integration**: Git workflow for refactoring
  - Small, atomic commits for each refactoring step
  - Clear commit messages describing transformations
  - Branch strategy for experimental refactoring
  - Code review process for team coordination

- **Performance Monitoring**: Modern performance considerations
  - Bundle size impact of refactoring decisions
  - Runtime performance measurement tools
  - Memory usage profiling during development
  - Production monitoring for performance regression
