# Chapter 7: Encapsulation

## Chapter Overview
This chapter focuses on data protection and interface design refactorings updated for modern JavaScript, covering ES6 classes, modules, and contemporary encapsulation patterns in web development.

## Main Content
- **Record and Collection Encapsulation**
  - Encapsulate Record: Protecting data structures with object literals and classes
  - Encapsulate Collection: Proper handling of Maps, Sets, and arrays
  - Replace Primitive with Object: Leveraging JavaScript's type system effectively
  - Replace Temp with Query: Eliminating temporary variables through computed properties

- **Class and Module Organization**
  - Extract Class: Separating responsibilities in ES6 classes and React components
  - Inline Class: Merging unnecessary abstractions for simplicity
  - Hide Delegate: Implementing proper delegation patterns in modern JavaScript
  - Remove Middle Man: Eliminating unnecessary indirection layers

- **Modern JavaScript Encapsulation**
  - Private fields and methods using ES2022 private syntax
  - Module-based encapsulation with ES6 import/export patterns
  - Getter/setter optimization with modern JavaScript engines
  - Immutability patterns and functional data handling approaches

## Key Points
- ES6 classes and modules provide enhanced encapsulation capabilities compared to function-based patterns
- Modern JavaScript engines optimize getter/setter patterns making encapsulation less performance-critical
- Component-based architectures (React, Vue) require specific encapsulation strategies for props and state
