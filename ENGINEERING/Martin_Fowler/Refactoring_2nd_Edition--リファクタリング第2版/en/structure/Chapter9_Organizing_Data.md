# Chapter 9: Organizing Data

## Chapter Overview
This chapter focuses on modern data processing patterns and immutability-focused approaches, emphasizing JavaScript's dynamic nature and functional programming influence on data organization.

## Main Content
- **Variable and Data Management**
  - Split Variable: Separating multiple responsibilities within single variables
  - Rename Field: Improving clarity of object property and class field names
  - Replace Derived Variable with Query (New): Using getters and computed properties
  - Change Reference to Value: Converting to immutable data patterns

- **Reference vs Value Semantics**
  - Change Value to Reference: Managing object identity and shared state
  - JavaScript object identity considerations and equality comparisons
  - Immutability patterns using Object.freeze, spread operators, and immutable libraries
  - Memory management implications of reference vs value approaches

- **Modern Data Patterns**
  - Functional data transformation using map, filter, reduce patterns
  - ES6+ destructuring and spread operators for data manipulation
  - JSON handling and API data transformation patterns
  - State management patterns for React, Vue, and other frameworks

## Key Points
- JavaScript's dynamic typing requires careful consideration of data transformation patterns
- Modern frameworks emphasize immutability and functional data handling approaches
- Computed properties and getters provide elegant solutions for derived data management
