# Chapter 6: A First Set of Refactorings

## Chapter Overview
This chapter presents the most fundamental refactoring techniques updated for modern JavaScript development, incorporating ES6+ features and introducing new techniques influenced by functional programming paradigms.

## Main Content
- **Function-Level Refactorings**
  - Extract Function: Breaking down complex functions with modern JavaScript patterns
  - Inline Function: Removing unnecessary indirection while preserving clarity
  - Extract Variable: Improving readability of complex expressions with destructuring
  - Rename Variable: Clarifying intent with meaningful naming conventions

- **Parameter and Object Improvements**
  - Introduce Parameter Object: Grouping related parameters with destructuring support
  - Change Function Declaration: Improving function signatures and interfaces
  - Combine Functions into Class: Organizing related functions with ES6 classes
  - Combine Functions into Transform (New): Functional programming pipeline techniques

- **Modern JavaScript-Specific Enhancements**
  - ES6+ feature utilization: Arrow functions, template literals, destructuring assignment
  - Asynchronous processing improvements: async/await pattern applications
  - Split Phase (New): Separating processing stages for clarity and maintainability

## Key Points
- JavaScript-specific features (arrow functions, destructuring, template literals) enhance refactoring effectiveness
- Functional programming influence introduces new techniques like "Combine Functions into Transform" and "Split Phase"
- Modern IDE assistance enables practical automated refactoring at professional development levels
