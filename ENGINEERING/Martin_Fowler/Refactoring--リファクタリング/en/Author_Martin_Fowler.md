# Author: Martin Fowler

## Martin Fowler at the Time of Writing Refactoring (1999)

When "Refactoring" was published in 1999, Martin Fowler was 36 years old and already an established thought leader in object-oriented design and software development methodologies. Based in Massachusetts, he was working as an independent consultant specializing in enterprise application architecture and object-oriented analysis and design. His collaboration with Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, and other pioneers of agile development was shaping what would become the Agile Manifesto just two years later.
