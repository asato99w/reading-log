# Chapter 4: Building Tests

## Chapter Overview
This chapter establishes testing as the fundamental prerequisite for safe refactoring. It introduces self-testing code concepts and practical testing strategies using JUnit.

## Main Content
- **The Value of Self-Testing Code**
  - Code that can verify its own correctness
  - Tests as specification and documentation
  - Confidence in making changes
  - Rapid feedback on modifications

- **The JUnit Testing Framework**
  - Introduction to unit testing concepts
  - Writing simple test cases
  - Test fixtures and setup/teardown
  - Assertions and test verification
  - Running and interpreting test results

- **Adding Tests to Existing Code**
  - Strategies for testing code without tests
  - Identifying testable units
  - Creating characterization tests
  - Building up test coverage incrementally
  - Dealing with dependencies and external systems

- **Test Coverage and Strategy**
  - How much testing is enough for refactoring
  - Focus on behavior verification, not implementation
  - Testing at appropriate levels of granularity
  - Balancing test coverage with development speed

- **Testing Challenges**
  - Dealing with databases and persistent data
  - Testing user interfaces and presentation layers
  - Handling external dependencies and services
  - Time-dependent and non-deterministic behavior

## Key Points
- Tests are not optional for refactoring - they are essential safety net
- Self-testing code enables confident change
- Focus on testing behavior that matters for refactoring safety
