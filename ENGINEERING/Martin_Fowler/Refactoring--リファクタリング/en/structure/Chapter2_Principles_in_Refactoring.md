# Chapter 2: Principles in Refactoring

## Chapter Overview
This foundational chapter defines refactoring, explains its benefits, and addresses common concerns. It establishes the theoretical and practical framework that underlies all refactoring activities.

## Main Content
- **Defining Refactoring**
  - Noun definition: A change made to internal structure without changing external behavior
  - Verb definition: The process of restructuring existing code
  - Relationship to design improvement and code evolution
  - Distinction between refactoring and rewriting

- **Why Should You Refactor?**
  - Improves design of software by reducing code decay
  - Makes software easier to understand for humans
  - Helps you find bugs by clarifying code structure
  - Helps you program faster by making changes easier
  - Economic benefits of maintaining code quality

- **When Should You Refactor?**
  - Rule of Three: First time do it, second time cringe, third time refactor
  - When you add a function: refactor first to make addition easy
  - When you need to fix a bug: refactoring reveals the problem
  - When you do a code review: shared knowledge improves design
  - Refactoring as part of regular development rhythm

- **Why Not to Refactor?**
  - When you should rewrite from scratch instead
  - When you're close to a deadline
  - Performance concerns that require measurement first
  - Legacy code without adequate test coverage

- **Refactoring and Design**
  - How refactoring changes the design process
  - Evolutionary design vs. upfront design
  - Design patterns as refactoring targets
  - Balancing simplicity and flexibility

## Key Points
- Refactoring is a disciplined technique, not random code cleanup
- Small, behavior-preserving changes accumulate to significant improvements
- Tests are essential for safe refactoring
