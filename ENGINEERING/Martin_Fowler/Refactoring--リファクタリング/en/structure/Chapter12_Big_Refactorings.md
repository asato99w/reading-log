# Chapter 12: Big Refactorings

## Chapter Overview
This chapter addresses large-scale refactorings that require significant time and effort but can transform entire systems. These refactorings often take weeks or months but enable fundamental architectural improvements.

## Main Content
- **Tease Apart Inheritance**
  - Problem: Inheritance hierarchy doing two jobs at once
  - Solution: Create separate hierarchies for each responsibility
  - Mechanics: Identify the two jobs, create new hierarchy, move behavior
  - When inheritance has become tangled and confusing

- **Convert Procedural Design to Objects**
  - Problem: Code written in procedural style with objects as data holders
  - Solution: Move behavior from procedural modules to objects
  - Mechanics: Identify behavior clusters, create classes, move methods
  - Transforming legacy procedural code to object-oriented design

- **Separate Domain from Presentation**
  - Problem: GUI code mixed with business logic
  - Solution: Create separate domain model independent of presentation
  - Mechanics: Extract domain classes, move business rules, create interfaces
  - Enabling multiple presentations and testable business logic

- **Extract Hierarchy**
  - Problem: Complex conditional logic based on type codes
  - Solution: Create class hierarchy with polymorphic behavior
  - Mechanics: Create subclasses, move conditional branches, apply polymorphism
  - Replacing large switch statements with object-oriented design

## Key Points
- Big refactorings require careful planning and gradual execution
- They address fundamental architectural problems that can't be solved incrementally
- Success depends on maintaining system functionality throughout the transformation
- These refactorings often take months but can dramatically improve system design
