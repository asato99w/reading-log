# Overall Structure: Refactoring (1st Edition)

## Book Organization and Documentation Approach

"Refactoring" is structured as both a manifesto for code improvement and a comprehensive reference catalog. The book progresses from motivation through principles to detailed mechanics, with the catalog forming the book's core. The organization reflects Fowler's philosophy of learning through examples, with every concept grounded in concrete code demonstrations.

## Major Parts and Chapter Structure

The structure of "Refactoring" reflects its dual nature as both manifesto and manual, teaching text and reference work. Its organization from concrete example through principles to detailed catalog has proven so effective that it has become a template for technical books. The systematic cataloging of refactorings with consistent format and clear mechanics transformed an ad-hoc practice into a professional discipline, fundamentally changing how developers approach code improvement.
