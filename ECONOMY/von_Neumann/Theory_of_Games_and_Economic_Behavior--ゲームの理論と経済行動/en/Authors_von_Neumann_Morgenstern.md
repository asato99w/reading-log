# John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern

## John von Neumann (1903-1957)

### Biography
John von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, and polymath who made major contributions across multiple fields. He is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century.

### Mathematical Career
- Born in Budapest, Hungary, to a wealthy banking family
- PhD in Mathematics from University of Budapest (1926)
- Professor at Princeton University and later Institute for Advanced Study
- Made fundamental contributions to set theory, functional analysis, quantum mechanics, and computer science
- Key figure in the Manhattan Project during World War II

### Major Contributions
- **Pure Mathematics**: Contributions to set theory, measure theory, and functional analysis
- **Applied Mathematics**: Work on fluid dynamics, shock waves, and numerical analysis
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Mathematical foundations of quantum theory
- **Computer Science**: Pioneered stored-program computer architecture (von Neumann architecture)
- **Game Theory**: Co-founded the field with the minimax theorem and this seminal work

## Oskar Morgenstern (1902-1977)

### Biography
Oskar Morgenstern was an Austrian-American economist who emigrated to the United States and became a key figure in mathematical economics and game theory.

### Academic Career
- Born in GÃ¶rlitz, Germany (now Poland)
- Studied at University of Vienna under leading Austrian economists
- Director of Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research (1931-1938)
- Emigrated to US in 1938, joined Princeton University
- Professor of Economics at Princeton (1938-1970)

### Economic Contributions
- **Business Cycle Theory**: Early work on economic fluctuations and forecasting
- **Mathematical Economics**: Pioneer in applying rigorous mathematical methods to economics
- **Game Theory**: Co-developed the economic applications and interpretations
- **Defense Economics**: Later work on military strategy and national security economics

## The Collaboration

### How They Met
- Both were at Princeton in the early 1940s
- Morgenstern attended von Neumann's lectures on game theory
- Began collaborating on economic applications of mathematical game theory
- Worked together from 1941-1944 on the book

### Division of Labor
- **Von Neumann**: Provided mathematical foundations, proofs, and theoretical framework
- **Morgenstern**: Contributed economic interpretations, applications, and real-world examples
- **Joint Effort**: Integration of mathematical rigor with economic insight

### Working Relationship
- Complementary skills: von Neumann's mathematical genius + Morgenstern's economic expertise
- Regular meetings and discussions at Princeton
- Morgenstern helped translate mathematical concepts into economic language
- Von Neumann ensured mathematical precision and generality

## The Book's Genesis

### Motivation
- Dissatisfaction with existing economic theory's lack of mathematical rigor
- Recognition that economic situations often involve strategic interactions
- Desire to create a new mathematical framework for economics
- War context highlighted importance of strategic thinking

### Writing Process
- Extensive collaboration over three years (1941-1944)
- Multiple drafts and revisions
- Careful integration of mathematical proofs with economic examples
- Attention to both theoretical completeness and practical applicability

### Impact of Their Partnership
- Created entirely new field of study
- Established template for mathematical economics
- Influenced generations of economists and mathematicians
- Showed power of interdisciplinary collaboration

## Individual Later Careers

### Von Neumann After 1944
- Continued work on computers and automata theory
- Contributed to hydrogen bomb development
- Work on self-reproducing machines and artificial life
- Died relatively young in 1957

### Morgenstern After 1944
- Continued developing game theory applications
- Founded Mathematica policy research organization
- Work on defense and national security economics
- Promoted game theory in economics profession

## Legacy of Their Collaboration
- Established game theory as fundamental tool in economics
- Created mathematical framework still used today
- Influenced development of decision theory and operations research
- Set standard for mathematical rigor in social sciences
- Their utility theory became foundation for modern microeconomics

## Personal Characteristics

### Von Neumann
- Legendary memory and computational ability
