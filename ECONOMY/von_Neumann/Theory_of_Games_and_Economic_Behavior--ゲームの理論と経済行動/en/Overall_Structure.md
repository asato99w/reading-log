# Theory of Games and Economic Behavior - Overall Structure

## Book Overview
"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior" is the foundational work that established modern game theory and mathematical economics. Published in 1944, this collaboration between mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern created an entirely new framework for analyzing strategic interactions and economic behavior.
