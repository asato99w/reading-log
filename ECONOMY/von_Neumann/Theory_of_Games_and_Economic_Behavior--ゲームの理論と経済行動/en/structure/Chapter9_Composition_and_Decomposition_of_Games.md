# Chapter 9: Composition and Decomposition of Games

## Chapter Overview
Von Neumann and Morgenstern explore how complex games can be built from simpler components and how large games can be decomposed for analysis, with applications to organizational theory and hierarchical structures.

## Main Content
- **Game Composition**
  - Building complex games from simple ones
  - Sequential and simultaneous composition
  - Hierarchical game structures

- **Game Decomposition**
  - Breaking down complex games for analysis
  - Identifying subgames and their solutions
  - Simplification techniques

- **Organizational Applications**
  - Firms as composed games
  - Management hierarchies and delegation
  - Multi-level decision making

## Key Points
- Complex economic situations can be analyzed through composition/decomposition
- Hierarchical structures create nested game situations
- Organizations exhibit game-theoretic structures at multiple levels
