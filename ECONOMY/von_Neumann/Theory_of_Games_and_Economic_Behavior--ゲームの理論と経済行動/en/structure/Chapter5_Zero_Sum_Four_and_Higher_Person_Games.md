# Chapter 5: Zero-Sum Four and Higher Person Games

## Chapter Overview
Von Neumann and Morgenstern generalize their analysis to n-person games, exploring coalition structures, stability concepts, and the computational challenges that arise with larger numbers of players.

## Main Content
- **N-Person Game Theory**
  - Generalization beyond three players
  - Coalition structures and possible alliances
  - Combinatorial explosion of strategic possibilities

- **Coalition Analysis**
  - Formation of multiple coalitions
  - Size and composition of stable coalitions
  - Inter-coalition competition and cooperation

- **Solution Concepts**
  - The core and its properties
  - Stable sets and their existence
  - Computational and theoretical challenges

## Key Points
- N-person games exhibit rich coalition structures
- Solution concepts become more complex and less determinate
- Computational challenges increase exponentially with player numbers
