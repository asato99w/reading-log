# Chapter 12: Utility Theory

## Chapter Overview
The authors establish the mathematical foundations of rational choice through their famous utility theorem, providing axiomatic foundations for expected utility theory and behavioral assumptions underlying economic analysis.

## Main Content
- **Axiomatic Approach to Preferences**
  - Fundamental assumptions about rational choice
  - Completeness, transitivity, and continuity
  - Independence axiom for risky choices

- **Von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility Theorem**
  - Representation theorem for preferences over lotteries
  - Expected utility as rational choice under uncertainty
  - Uniqueness properties of utility functions

- **Behavioral Foundations**
  - Rationality assumptions and their implications
  - Risk attitudes and utility curvature
  - Experimental and empirical considerations

## Key Points
- Rational choice can be given precise mathematical foundation
- Expected utility theory provides framework for decision under uncertainty
- Behavioral assumptions are crucial for economic modeling
