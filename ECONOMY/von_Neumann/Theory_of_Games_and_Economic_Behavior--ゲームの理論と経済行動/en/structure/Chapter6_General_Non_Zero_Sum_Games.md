# Chapter 6: General Non-Zero-Sum Games

## Chapter Overview
The authors move beyond strictly competitive situations to analyze games where players' interests are not diametrically opposed, introducing concepts of cooperation, Pareto efficiency, and the challenges of defining solutions in mixed-motive games.

## Main Content
- **Non-Zero-Sum Game Structure**
  - Games with mutual gains possible
  - Mixed motives: competition and cooperation
  - Variable-sum vs. constant-sum situations

- **Cooperative vs. Non-Cooperative Games**
  - Binding vs. non-binding agreements
  - Communication and negotiation possibilities
  - Enforcement mechanisms and credibility

- **Efficiency and Optimality**
  - Pareto optimal outcomes
  - Social welfare and individual rationality
  - Conflict between efficiency and stability

## Key Points
- Non-zero-sum games allow for mutual gains and cooperation
- Solution concepts become more complex without strict competition
- Efficiency and stability may conflict in mixed-motive situations
