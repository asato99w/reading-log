# Chapter 1: Formulation of the Economic Problem

## Chapter Overview
Von Neumann and Morgenstern critique existing economic theory and introduce the concept of games as a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic economic interactions.

## Main Content
- **Critique of Classical Economics**
  - Limitations of Robinson Crusoe economics
  - Problems with partial equilibrium analysis
  - Need for mathematical rigor in economic theory

- **Introduction to Game Theory**
  - Economic situations as strategic games
  - Players, strategies, and outcomes
  - Difference between parametric and strategic optimization

- **Methodological Framework**
  - Mathematical vs. intuitive approaches
  - Importance of formal definitions and proofs
  - Setting up the analytical foundation

## Key Points
- Traditional economic theory inadequately handles strategic interactions
- Game theory provides a rigorous mathematical framework for economics
- Economic problems require analysis of interdependent decision-making
