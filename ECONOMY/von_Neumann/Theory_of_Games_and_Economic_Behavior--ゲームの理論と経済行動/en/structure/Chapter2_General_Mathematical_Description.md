# Chapter 2: General Mathematical Description

## Chapter Overview
The authors provide the formal mathematical definition of games, establishing the fundamental concepts of players, strategies, payoffs, and information structures that form the foundation of game theory.

## Main Content
- **Formal Definition of Games**
  - Mathematical representation of strategic situations
  - Players as decision-making entities
  - Strategy sets and feasible actions

- **Game Structure Elements**
  - Payoff functions and utility representations
  - Information structures and knowledge
  - Timing and sequential vs. simultaneous play

- **Mathematical Preliminaries**
  - Set theory foundations
  - Notation and formal language
  - Assumptions about rationality and knowledge

## Key Points
- Games are precisely defined mathematical objects
- All strategic situations can be represented in this framework
- Mathematical rigor enables systematic analysis of complex interactions
