# Chapter 7: Economic Interpretation of Results

## Chapter Overview
Von Neumann and Morgenstern translate their mathematical game theory results into economic language, connecting abstract solution concepts to market mechanisms, competition, and economic efficiency.

## Main Content
- **Translation to Economics**
  - Mathematical results in economic terms
  - Strategic behavior in markets
  - Connection to price theory and competition

- **Market Mechanisms**
  - Markets as games between participants
  - Price formation through strategic interaction
  - Role of information and market structure

- **Welfare Implications**
  - Efficiency properties of game solutions
  - Distribution and equity considerations
  - Relationship to classical welfare economics

## Key Points
- Game theory provides new insights into market behavior
- Strategic interactions affect efficiency and distribution
- Classical economic assumptions need revision in light of game theory
