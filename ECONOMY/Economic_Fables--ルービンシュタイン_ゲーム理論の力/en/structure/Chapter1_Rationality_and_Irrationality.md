# Chapter 1: Rationality and Irrationality

## Chapter Overview
Rubinstein examines the foundational assumption of rationality in economics, using personal anecdotes and theoretical examples to show how human behavior deviates from the rational ideal. He questions whether the concept of rationality as used in economics captures anything meaningful about actual human decision-making.

## Main Content

### The Rational Choice Paradigm
- Standard assumptions of completeness and transitivity
- Utility maximization as the behavioral foundation
- The elegance of the rational choice framework
- Why economists cling to rationality assumptions

### Personal Examples of Irrationality
- Story of choosing a refrigerator: paralysis from too many options
- Restaurant menu decisions: context effects and irrelevant alternatives
- Academic job market choices: non-optimizing behavior
- Family anecdotes illustrating systematic departures from rationality

### Theoretical Challenges
- Allais paradox and violations of expected utility
- Framing effects and reference dependence
- Time inconsistency and self-control problems
- Bounded rationality and satisficing behavior

### Defense and Critique
- The "as if" methodology: do assumptions matter?
- Rationality as normative ideal vs. descriptive tool
- When rational models work and when they fail
- The cost of abandoning rationality assumptions

## Key Points
- Rational choice theory provides elegant models but poor descriptions
- Personal experience consistently contradicts theoretical predictions
- The gap between theory and behavior raises questions about economics' foundations
