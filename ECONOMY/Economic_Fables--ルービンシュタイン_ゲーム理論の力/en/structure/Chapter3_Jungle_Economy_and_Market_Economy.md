# Chapter 3: Jungle Economy and Market Economy

## Chapter Overview
Rubinstein contrasts two fundamental visions of economic organization: the "jungle economy" of pure competition and survival of the fittest, versus the "market economy" with rules, institutions, and possibilities for cooperation. Through fables and analysis, he explores which better captures economic reality.
