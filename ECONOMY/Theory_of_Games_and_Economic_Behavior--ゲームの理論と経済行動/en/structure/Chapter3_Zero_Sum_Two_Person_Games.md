# Chapter 3: Zero-Sum Two-Person Games

## Chapter Overview
The authors analyze the fundamental case of strictly competitive games between two players, establishing the minimax theorem and introducing mixed strategies as the foundation of game theory.

## Main Content
- **Zero-Sum Game Structure**
  - Definition of strictly competitive situations
  - Payoff matrices and strategic form
  - Pure strategies and deterministic play

- **The Minimax Theorem**
  - Fundamental existence result for game theory
  - Mathematical proof and implications
  - Minimax value and optimal strategies

- **Mixed Strategies**
  - Randomization as optimal behavior
  - Probability distributions over pure strategies
  - Solution concepts for mixed strategy equilibria

## Key Points
- Zero-sum games have unique solutions through the minimax theorem
- Mixed strategies are often necessary for optimal play
- This framework provides the foundation for all subsequent game theory
