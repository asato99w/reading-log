# Chapter 4: Zero-Sum Three-Person Games

## Chapter Overview
The authors extend the analysis to three-player games, introducing the crucial concept of coalition formation and demonstrating how the addition of a third player fundamentally changes the nature of strategic interaction.

## Main Content
- **Three-Player Game Dynamics**
  - Qualitative difference from two-player games
  - Emergence of coalition possibilities
  - Strategic complexity and multiple equilibria

- **Coalition Formation**
  - Two-player coalitions against the third
  - Stability and instability of coalitions
  - Bargaining and side payments

- **Solution Concepts**
  - Multiple possible outcomes
  - The core and other stability concepts
  - Examples and economic interpretations

## Key Points
- Three-player games introduce coalition formation as a central concept
- Solutions are no longer unique, leading to multiple equilibria
- The strategic complexity increases dramatically beyond two players
