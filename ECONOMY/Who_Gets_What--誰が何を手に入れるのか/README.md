**Title**: Who Gets What — and Why: The New Economics of Matchmaking and Market Design  
**Author**: Alvin E. Roth  
**Japanese Title**: 誰が何を手に入れるのか  
**First Published**: 2015  
**Subject**: Market Design, Matching Theory, Economics, Game Theory

## Book Description
"Who Gets What — and Why" explores the fascinating world of matching markets and market design. Nobel Prize winner Alvin Roth explains how economists can design better ways to allocate scarce resources, from school assignments to organ transplants. The book demonstrates how market design has moved from theoretical economics to practical solutions that improve millions of lives.

## Author's Expertise
Alvin Roth is a pioneer in market design and matching theory, awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. His work has practical applications in:
- **Medical residency matching** - National Resident Matching Program
- **School choice systems** - Boston and New York school assignments
- **Kidney exchange** - New England Program for Kidney Exchange
- **Spectrum auctions** - FCC wireless spectrum allocation

## Key Themes

### Market Design Fundamentals
- How markets work when price alone doesn't clear them
- The importance of matching preferences on both sides
- Stability, efficiency, and strategy-proofness in market design
- Real-world constraints that pure market theory often ignores

### Successful Matching Markets
- **Thickness**: Enough participants to make good matches
- **Safety**: Participants can reveal preferences without gaming
- **No Congestion**: Sufficient time and information for good decisions
- **Stability**: Self-enforcing outcomes that participants accept

### Applications and Case Studies
- Medical residency matching in the United States
- School choice in Boston, New York, and other cities
- Kidney exchange programs for transplant patients
- Online dating and matching platforms
