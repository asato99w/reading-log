# Chapter 3: Medical Residency Matching

## Chapter Overview
Roth traces the history of medical residency matching from chaotic early systems to the current stable National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). This chapter demonstrates how market design theory explains historical failures and enables successful reforms.

## Main Content

### Historical Evolution
- **Early Chaos**: Uncoordinated hiring leading to earlier and earlier offers
- **Market Unraveling**: Competition pushing decisions before adequate information
- **Failed Attempts**: Various efforts to coordinate timing and improve outcomes
- **Instability**: Systems that participants wanted to circumvent or abandon

### The Matching Problem
- **Two-Sided Preferences**: Both medical students and hospitals rank each other
- **Complexity**: Thousands of students and residency positions to coordinate
- **Information Timing**: Balancing early decisions with adequate evaluation
- **Multiple Objectives**: Matching preferences while maintaining educational quality

### Gale-Shapley Algorithm Application
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Stable matching theory from 1962
- **Student-Optimal Version**: Algorithm favors medical students' preferences
- **Stability Guarantee**: No pair of student and hospital prefer each other to current match
- **Strategy-Proofness**: Students benefit from submitting true preferences

### National Resident Matching Program (NRMP)
- **Implementation**: Successful adoption of market design principles
- **Scale**: Matches over 40,000 medical graduates annually
- **Success Metrics**: High satisfaction rates and stable participation
- **Continuous Improvement**: Ongoing refinements based on experience

### Special Challenges
- **Couples Matching**: Accommodating married medical students
- **Specialty Coordination**: Matching across different medical specialties
- **International Medical Graduates**: Integrating foreign-trained doctors
- **Unfilled Positions**: Managing unmatched students and residencies

### International Applications
- **Global Adoption**: Similar systems in other countries' medical training
- **Local Adaptation**: Adjusting for different healthcare systems
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Sharing expertise and technical solutions
- **Comparative Analysis**: Learning from different implementation approaches

## Key Points
- Historical failures provide natural experiments in market design
- Stable mechanisms prevent market unraveling and improve outcomes
- Success requires both theoretical understanding and practical refinement
