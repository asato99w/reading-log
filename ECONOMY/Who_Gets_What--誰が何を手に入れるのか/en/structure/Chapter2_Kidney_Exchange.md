# Chapter 2: Kidney Exchange

## Chapter Overview
This chapter tells the compelling story of how market design has literally saved lives by creating kidney exchange programs. Roth explains how paired donation systems overcome immunological incompatibility and shortage of donor organs, representing one of market design's most dramatic successes.

## Main Content

### The Kidney Crisis
- **Organ Shortage**: Over 100,000 Americans on kidney waiting lists
- **Dialysis Burden**: Expensive, time-consuming, quality-of-life reducing treatment
- **Mortality Risk**: Significant death rates while waiting for transplants
- **Immunological Barriers**: Many willing donors incompatible with their intended recipients

### Paired Kidney Exchange Concept
- **Basic Idea**: Incompatible pairs swap kidneys with other incompatible pairs
- **Compatibility Chains**: Creating longer chains of donations
- **Computer Matching**: Algorithms to find optimal kidney swaps
- **Timing Coordination**: Simultaneous surgeries to prevent defection

### New England Program for Kidney Exchange (NEPKE)
- **Founding**: Roth's collaboration with medical professionals
- **Initial Challenges**: Hospital skepticism and logistical complexities
- **Early Success**: First successful paired donations
- **Growth**: Expansion to more hospitals and patients

### Kidney Chains and Altruistic Donors
- **Chain Concept**: Single altruistic donor triggers sequence of donations
- **Longer Chains**: More flexibility and matches than simple pairs
- **Non-Directed Donation**: Altruistic donors without specific recipients
- **Bridge Donors**: Donors who wait to complete chains

### Scaling Up
- **National Kidney Registry**: Expanding beyond regional programs
- **International Cooperation**: Cross-border kidney exchanges
- **Technological Improvements**: Better matching algorithms and logistics
- **Policy Support**: Government backing for exchange programs

### Overcoming Obstacles
- **Medical Ethics**: Concerns about coercion and commercialization
- **Legal Framework**: Ensuring compliance with organ donation laws
- **Hospital Coordination**: Managing complex multi-site surgeries
- **Patient Education**: Helping families understand exchange options

## Key Points
- Market design can solve problems where traditional markets fail completely
- Successful implementation requires deep collaboration with domain experts
- Technological solutions must be combined with institutional and cultural change
