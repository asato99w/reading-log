# Introduction: Why Market Design Matters

## Chapter Overview
Roth introduces the concept that markets don't always work through price mechanisms alone, and that many important allocation problems require careful design rather than relying on natural market forces. He sets up the book's central thesis that economic theory can solve real-world problems when properly applied.

- Need for sophisticated matching mechanisms

### Market Design Principles
- **Thickness**: Markets need enough participants to make good matches possible
- **Avoiding Congestion**: Systems must handle information processing and timing
- **Safety to Participate**: People need incentives to reveal true preferences
- **Overcoming Repugnance**: Some efficient solutions face cultural resistance

### Success Stories Preview
- Medical residency matching affecting thousands of doctors annually
- School choice systems serving hundreds of thousands of students
- Kidney exchange programs saving lives through paired donations
- Spectrum auctions generating billions in revenue while improving allocation

### The Promise of Market Design
- Economic theory can improve real-world outcomes
- Proper design can increase efficiency while maintaining fairness
- Success requires understanding both theory and institutional constraints
- Market design represents economics at its most practical and beneficial

## Key Points
- Markets require design, not just regulation or laissez-faire approaches
- Successful market design combines rigorous theory with practical implementation
- The field has already generated significant improvements in welfare and efficiency
