# Part II: Communication

## Part Overview
This section explores how information flows between minds and the critical role of shared context in human communication. NÃ¸rretranders reveals that effective communication depends far more on implicit, shared knowledge (exformation) than on explicit information transfer, and examines the severe bandwidth limitations that constrain conscious processing.

## Main Content

### The Bandwidth Problem
- Quantitative analysis of conscious information processing capacity
- Comparison between conscious (16-40 bits/second) and unconscious processing rates
- How attention creates a severe bottleneck in information flow
- The evolutionary advantages of limited conscious bandwidth

### Context and Implicit Knowledge
- The crucial role of shared cultural and personal context in communication
- How background knowledge enables efficient information compression
- Why successful communication requires extensive common ground
- The relationship between exformation and cultural understanding

### The Economics of Attention
- Attention as a limited resource that must be allocated efficiently
- How the brain filters and prioritizes information for conscious awareness
- The cost-benefit analysis underlying attention and consciousness
- Why most information must be processed unconsciously

### Communication Beyond Words
- Non-verbal communication and its information content
- The role of emotional and social context in meaning creation
- How shared experiences and cultural knowledge shape interpretation
- Why artificial intelligence struggles with human-like communication

## Key Points

1. **Bandwidth Constraints**: Human conscious awareness operates under severe bandwidth limitations, processing only 16-40 bits per second compared to the millions of bits processed unconsciously, creating a fundamental bottleneck in information flow.

2. **Exformation Dependence**: Effective human communication relies primarily on vast amounts of shared, implicit knowledge rather than explicit information transfer - what is not said is often more important than what is said.

3. **Attention Economics**: The scarcity of conscious attention requires sophisticated filtering and prioritization mechanisms, meaning that most information processing must occur outside awareness to maintain cognitive efficiency.
