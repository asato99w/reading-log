## Clinical Philosophy
Sacks revolutionized neurological practice by emphasizing the whole person rather than isolated symptoms. His approach combines rigorous clinical observation with deep empathy for patients' subjective experiences, creating what would later be recognized as "narrative medicine."

## Scientific Contributions
His work with "awakening" post-encephalitic patients provided crucial insights into consciousness, identity, and neurological recovery. These studies, spanning decades, demonstrated the importance of long-term patient relationships in understanding complex neurological conditions.
