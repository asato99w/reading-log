2. **Developmental Nature**: Unlike IQ which remains relatively stable, emotional intelligence can be developed and improved throughout life through practice, feedback, and deliberate effort, offering hope for personal growth and enhanced relationships at any age.

3. **Integrated Competence**: These five components don't operate in isolation but interact dynamically, with self-awareness providing the foundation for self-regulation, which enables better motivation, while empathy and social skills allow us to extend these capabilities to relationships and social situations.
