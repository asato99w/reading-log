## Key Points

1. **Social Alienation**: Exceptional abilities created profound social isolation, as S lived in a perceptual world that others could neither access nor fully understand, leading to communication difficulties and loneliness.

2. **Identity Complexity**: S struggled with questions of personal identity and worth, uncertain whether his abilities were a gift to be celebrated or a burden to be endured, reflecting broader questions about the value of cognitive exceptionality.

3. **Experiential Overwhelm**: The combination of perfect memory and rich synesthetic experience created a subjective world of overwhelming intensity, making it difficult to find peace, focus, or emotional equilibrium in daily life.
